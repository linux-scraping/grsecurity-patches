    connector/userns: replace netlink uses of cap_raised() with capable()
    
    In 2009 Philip Reiser notied that a few users of netlink connector
    interface needed a capability check and added the idiom
    cap_raised(nsp->eff_cap, CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to a few of them, on the premise
    that netlink was asynchronous.
    
    In 2011 Patrick McHardy noticed we were being silly because netlink is
    synchronous and removed eff_cap from the netlink_skb_params and changed
    the idiom to cap_raised(current_cap(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
    
    Looking at those spots with a fresh eye we should be calling
    capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN).  The only reason I can see for not calling capable
    is that it once appeared we were not in the same task as the caller which
    would have made calling capable() impossible.
    
    In the initial user_namespace the only difference between between
    cap_raised(current_cap(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN) and capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) are a
    few sanity checks and the fact that capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) sets
    PF_SUPERPRIV if we use the capability.
    
    Since we are going to be using root privilege setting PF_SUPERPRIV seems
    the right thing to do.
    
    The motivation for this that patch is that in a child user namespace
    cap_raised(current_cap(),...) tests your capabilities with respect to that
    child user namespace not capabilities in the initial user namespace and
    thus will allow processes that should be unprivielged to use the kernel
    services that are only protected with cap_raised(current_cap(),..).
    
    To fix possible user_namespace issues and to just clean up the code
    replace cap_raised(current_cap(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN) with
    capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN).

    dl2k: Clean up rio_ioctl
    
    The dl2k driver's rio_ioctl call has a few issues:
    - No permissions checking
    - Implements SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCGMIIREG using the SIOCDEVPRIVATE numbers
    - Has a few ioctls that may have been used for debugging at one point
      but have no place in the kernel proper.
    
    This patch removes all but the MII ioctls, renumbers them to use the
    standard ones, and adds the proper permission check for SIOCSMIIREG.
    
    We can also get rid of the dl2k-specific struct mii_data in favor of
    the generic struct mii_ioctl_data.
    
    Since we have the phyid on hand, we can add the SIOCGMIIPHY ioctl too.
    
    Most of the MII code for the driver could probably be converted to use
    the generic MII library but I don't have a device to test the results.

    i387: ptrace breaks the lazy-fpu-restore logic
    
    Starting from 7e16838d "i387: support lazy restore of FPU state"
    we assume that fpu_owner_task doesn't need restore_fpu_checking()
    on the context switch, its FPU state should match what we already
    have in the FPU on this CPU.
    
    However, debugger can change the tracee's FPU state, in this case
    we should reset fpu.last_cpu to ensure fpu_lazy_restore() can't
    return true.
    
    Change init_fpu() to do this, it is called by user_regset->set()
    methods.

    sparc64: Eliminate obsolete __handle_softirq() function
    
    The invocation of softirq is now handled by irq_exit(), so there is no
    need for sparc64 to invoke it on the trap-return path.  In fact, doing so
    is a bug because if the trap occurred in the idle loop, this invocation
    can result in lockdep-RCU failures.  The problem is that RCU ignores idle
    CPUs, and the sparc64 trap-return path to the softirq handlers fails to
    tell RCU that the CPU must be considered non-idle while those handlers
    are executing.  This means that RCU is ignoring any RCU read-side critical
    sections in those handlers, which in turn means that RCU-protected data
    can be yanked out from under those read-side critical sections.
    
    The shiny new lockdep-RCU ability to detect RCU read-side critical sections
    that RCU is ignoring located this problem.
    
    The fix is straightforward: Make sparc64 stop manually invoking the
    softirq handlers.

    do not export kernel's NULL #define to userspace
    
    GCC's NULL is actually __null, which allows detecting some questionable
    NULL usage and warn about it.  Moreover each platform/compiler should
    have its own stddef.h anyway (which is different from linux/stddef.h).
    
    So there's no good reason to leak kernel's NULL to userspace and

    KVM: unmap pages from the iommu when slots are removed
    
    We've been adding new mappings, but not destroying old mappings.
    This can lead to a page leak as pages are pinned using
    get_user_pages, but only unpinned with put_page if they still
    exist in the memslots list on vm shutdown.  A memslot that is
    destroyed while an iommu domain is enabled for the guest will
    therefore result in an elevated page reference count that is
    never cleared.
    
    Additionally, without this fix, the iommu is only programmed
    with the first translation for a gpa.  This can result in
    peer-to-peer errors if a mapping is destroyed and replaced by a
    new mapping at the same gpa as the iommu will still be pointing
    to the original, pinned memory address.

    panic: fix stack dump print on direct call to panic()
    
    Commit 6e6f0a1f0fa6 ("panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops")
    causes a regression where no stack trace will be printed at all for the
    case where kernel code calls panic() directly while not processing an
    oops, and of course there are 100's of instances of this type of call.
    
    The original commit executed the check (!oops_in_progress), but this will
    always be false because just before the dump_stack() there is a call to
    bust_spinlocks(1), which does the following:
    
      void __attribute__((weak)) bust_spinlocks(int yes)
      {
    	if (yes) {
    		++oops_in_progress;
    
    The proper way to resolve the problem that original commit tried to
    solve is to avoid printing a stack dump from panic() when the either of
    the following conditions is true:
    
      1) TAINT_DIE has been set (this is done by oops_end())
         This indicates and oops has already been printed.
      2) oops_in_progress > 1
         This guards against the rare case where panic() is invoked
         a second time, or in between oops_begin() and oops_end()

    drivers/char/random.c: fix boot id uniqueness race
    
    /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id can be read concurrently by userspace
    processes.  If two (or more) user-space processes concurrently read
    boot_id when sysctl_bootid is not yet assigned, a race can occur making
    boot_id differ between the reads.  Because the whole point of the boot id
    is to be unique across a kernel execution, fix this by protecting this
    operation with a spinlock.
    
    Given that this operation is not frequently used, hitting the spinlock
    on each call should not be an issue.

    vfs: get rid of batshit-insane pointless dentry hash calculations
    
    For some odd historical reason, the final mixing round for the dentry
    cache hash table lookup had an insane "xor with big constant" logic.  In
    two places.
    
    The big constant that is being xor'ed is GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME, which is a
    fairly random-looking number that is designed to be *multiplied* with so
    that the bits get spread out over a whole long-word.
    
    But xor'ing with it is insane.  It doesn't really even change the hash -
    it really only shifts the hash around in the hash table.  To make
    matters worse, the insane big constant is different on 32-bit and 64-bit
    builds, even though the name hash bits we use are always 32-bit (and the
    bits from the pointer we mix in effectively are too).
    
    It's all total voodoo programming, in other words.
    
    Now, some testing and analysis of the hash chains shows that the rest of
    the hash function seems to be fairly good.  It does pick the right bits
    of the parent dentry pointer, for example, and while it's generally a
    bad idea to use an xor to mix down the upper bits (because if there is a
    repeating pattern, the xor can cause "destructive interference"), it
    seems to not have been a disaster.
    
    For example, replacing the hash with the normal "hash_long()" code (that
    uses the GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME constant correctly, btw) actually just makes
    the hash worse.  The hand-picked hash knew which bits of the pointer had
    the highest entropy, and hash_long() ends up mixing bits less optimally
    at least in some trivial tests.
    
    So the hash function overall seems fine, it just has that really odd
    "shift result around by a constant xor".
    
    So get rid of the silly xor, and replace the down-mixing of the bits
    with an add instead of an xor that tends to not have the same kind of
    destructive interference issues.  Some stats on the resulting hash
    chains shows that they look statistically identical before and after,
    but the code is simpler and no longer makes you go "WTF?".
    
    Also, the incoming hash really is just "unsigned int", not a long, and
    there's no real point to worry about the high 26 bits of the dentry
    pointer for the 64-bit case, because they are all going to be identical
    anyway.
    
    So also change the hashing to be done in the more natural 'unsigned int'
    that is the real size of the actual hashed data anyway.

    ptrace_event(PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC) sends SIGTRAP if PT_TRACE_EXEC is not

    we do not need/want this with PT_SEIZED which can set the options during

    x86-32: Fix endless loop when processing signals for kernel tasks
    
    The problem occurs on !CONFIG_VM86 kernels [1] when a kernel-mode task
    returns from a system call with a pending signal.
    
    A real-life scenario is a child of 'khelper' returning from a failed
    kernel_execve() in ____call_usermodehelper() [ kernel/kmod.c ].
    kernel_execve() fails due to a pending SIGKILL, which is the result of
    "kill -9 -1" (at least, busybox's init does it upon reboot).
    
    The loop is as follows:
    
    * syscall_exit_work:
     - work_pending:            // start_of_the_loop
     - work_notify_sig:
       - do_notify_resume()
         - do_signal()
           - if (!user_mode(regs)) return;
     - resume_userspace         // TIF_SIGPENDING is still set
     - work_pending             // so we call work_pending => goto
                                // start_of_the_loop
    
    More information can be found in another LKML thread:
    http://www.serverphorums.com/read.php?12,457826
    
    [1] the problem was also seen on MIPS.

    tcp: fix syncookie regression
    
    commit ea4fc0d619 (ipv4: Don't use rt->rt_{src,dst} in ip_queue_xmit())
    added a serious regression on synflood handling.
    
    Simon Kirby discovered a successful connection was delayed by 20 seconds
    before being responsive.
    
    In my tests, I discovered that xmit frames were lost, and needed ~4
    retransmits and a socket dst rebuild before being really sent.
    
    In case of syncookie initiated connection, we use a different path to
    initialize the socket dst, and inet->cork.fl.u.ip4 is left cleared.
    
    As ip_queue_xmit() now depends on inet flow being setup, fix this by
    copying the temp flowi4 we use in cookie_v4_check().

    tun: don't hold network namespace by tun sockets
    
    v3: added previously removed sock_put() to the tun_release() callback, because
    sk_release_kernel() doesn't drop the socket reference.
    
    v2: sk_release_kernel() used for socket release. Dummy tun_release() is
    required for sk_release_kernel() ---> sock_release() ---> sock->ops->release()
    call.
    
    TUN was designed to destroy it's socket on network namesapce shutdown. But this
    will never happen for persistent device, because it's socket holds network
    namespace.
    This patch removes of holding network namespace by TUN socket and replaces it
    by creating socket in init_net and then changing it's net it to desired one. On
    shutdown socket is moved back to init_net prior to final put.

    vfs: Correctly set the dir i_mutex lockdep class
    
    9a7aa12f3911853a introduced additional logic around setting the i_mutex
    lockdep class for directory inodes. The idea was that some filesystems
    may want their own special lockdep class for different directory
    inodes and calling unlock_new_inode() should not clobber one of
    those special classes.
    
    I believe that the added conditional, around the *negated* return value
    of lockdep_match_class(), caused directory inodes to be placed in the
    wrong lockdep class.
    
    inode_init_always() sets the i_mutex lockdep class with i_mutex_key for
    all inodes. If the filesystem did not change the class during inode
    initialization, then the conditional mentioned above was false and the
    directory inode was incorrectly left in the non-directory lockdep class.
    If the filesystem did set a special lockdep class, then the conditional
    mentioned above was true and that class was clobbered with
    i_mutex_dir_key.
    
    This patch removes the negation from the conditional so that the i_mutex
    lockdep class is properly set for directory inodes. Special classes are
    preserved and directory inodes with unmodified classes are set with
    i_mutex_dir_key.

    udf: Fix deadlock in udf_release_file()
    
    udf_release_file() can be called from munmap() path with mmap_sem held.  Thus
    we cannot take i_mutex there because that ranks above mmap_sem. Luckily,
    i_mutex is not needed in udf_release_file() anymore since protection by
    i_data_sem is enough to protect from races with write and truncate.

    sparc32: Add -Av8 to assembler command line.
    
    Newer version of binutils are more strict about specifying the
    correct options to enable certain classes of instructions.
    
    The sparc32 build is done for v7 in order to support sun4c systems
    which lack hardware integer multiply and divide instructions.
    
    So we have to pass -Av8 when building the assembler routines that
    use these instructions and get patched into the kernel when we find
    out that we have a v8 capable cpu.

    x86: Derandom delay_tsc for 64 bit
    
    Commit f0fbf0abc093 ("x86: integrate delay functions") converted
    delay_tsc() into a random delay generator for 64 bit.  The reason is
    that it merged the mostly identical versions of delay_32.c and
    delay_64.c.  Though the subtle difference of the result was:
    
     static void delay_tsc(unsigned long loops)
     {
    -	unsigned bclock, now;
    +	unsigned long bclock, now;
    
    Now the function uses rdtscl() which returns the lower 32bit of the
    TSC. On 32bit that's not problematic as unsigned long is 32bit. On 64
    bit this fails when the lower 32bit are close to wrap around when
    bclock is read, because the following check
    
           if ((now - bclock) >= loops)
           	  	break;
    
    evaluated to true on 64bit for e.g. bclock = 0xffffffff and now = 0
    because the unsigned long (now - bclock) of these values results in
    0xffffffff00000001 which is definitely larger than the loops
    value. That explains Tvortkos observation:
    
    "Because I am seeing udelay(500) (_occasionally_) being short, and
     that by delaying for some duration between 0us (yep) and 491us."
    
    Make those variables explicitely u32 again, so this works for both 32
    and 64 bit.

    aio: fix the "too late munmap()" race
    
    Current code has put_ioctx() called asynchronously from aio_fput_routine();
    that's done *after* we have killed the request that used to pin ioctx,
    so there's nothing to stop io_destroy() waiting in wait_for_all_aios()
    from progressing.  As the result, we can end up with async call of
    put_ioctx() being the last one and possibly happening during exit_mmap()
    or elf_core_dump(), neither of which expects stray munmap() being done
    to them...
    
    We do need to prevent _freeing_ ioctx until aio_fput_routine() is done
    with that, but that's all we care about - neither io_destroy() nor
    exit_aio() will progress past wait_for_all_aios() until aio_fput_routine()
    does really_put_req(), so the ioctx teardown won't be done until then
    and we don't care about the contents of ioctx past that point.
    
    Since actual freeing of these suckers is RCU-delayed, we don't need to
    bump ioctx refcount when request goes into list for async removal.
    All we need is rcu_read_lock held just over the ->ctx_lock-protected
    area in aio_fput_routine().

    aio: fix io_setup/io_destroy race
    
    Have ioctx_alloc() return an extra reference, so that caller would drop it
    on success and not bother with re-grabbing it on failure exit.  The current
    code is obviously broken - io_destroy() from another thread that managed
    to guess the address io_setup() would've returned would free ioctx right
    under us; gets especially interesting if aio_context_t * we pass to
    io_setup() points to PROT_READ mapping, so put_user() fails and we end
    up doing io_destroy() on kioctx another thread has just got freed...

    Use a per-cpu 48-bit counter instead of a global atomic64
    Initialize each counter to have the cpu number in the lower 16 bits
    instead of incrementing the counter each time by 1, perform the increments
    above the cpu number so that wrapping/exhausting the counter doesn't corrupt
    any state

    Special vnsec edition! :)
    Further reduce argv/env allowance for suid/sgid apps to 512KB
    Clamp suid/sgid stack resource limit to 8MB (preventing compat mmap layout fallback/too large stack gap)
    Clear 3GB personality on suid/sgid binaries
    Restore 4 bits entropy in the lowest bits of arg/env strings (now 28 bits on x86, 39 bits on x64)
      with the main purpose of throwing off program stack -> arg/env alignment

    mm: fix find_vma_prev
    
    Commit 6bd4837de96e ("mm: simplify find_vma_prev()") broke memory
    management on PA-RISC.
    
    After application of the patch, programs that allocate big arrays on the
    stack crash with segfault, for example, this will crash if compiled
    without optimization:
    
      int main()
      {
    	char array[200000];
    	array[199999] = 0;
    	return 0;
      }
    
    The reason is that PA-RISC has up-growing stack and the stack is usually
    the last memory area.  In the above example, a page fault happens above
    the stack.
    
    Previously, if we passed too high address to find_vma_prev, it returned
    NULL and stored the last VMA in *pprev.  After "simplify find_vma_prev"
    change, it stores NULL in *pprev.  Consequently, the stack area is not
    found and it is not expanded, as it used to be before the change.
    
    This patch restores the old behavior and makes it return the last VMA in
    *pprev if the requested address is higher than address of any other VMA.

    vsprintf: make %pV handling compatible with kasprintf()
    
    kasprintf() (and potentially other functions that I didn't run across so
    far) want to evaluate argument lists twice.  Caring to do so for the
    primary list is obviously their job, but they can't reasonably be
    expected to check the format string for instances of %pV, which however
    need special handling too: On architectures like x86-64 (as opposed to
    e.g.  ix86), using the same argument list twice doesn't produce the
    expected results, as an internally managed cursor gets updated during
    the first run.
    
    Fix the problem by always acting on a copy of the original list when
    handling %pV.

    regset: Prevent null pointer reference on readonly regsets
    
    The regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets would always
    have .get and .set methods, but not necessarily .active methods.
    Unfortunately people have since written regsets without .set methods.
    
    Rather than putting in stub functions everywhere, handle regsets with
    null .get or .set methods explicitly.

    We use len to store the return value from eth_header().  eth_header()
    can return -ETH_HLEN (-14).  We want to pass this back instead of
    truncating it to 65522 and returning that.

    exec: fix use-after-free bug in setup_new_exec()
    
    Setting the task name is done within setup_new_exec() by accessing
    bprm->filename. However this happens after flush_old_exec().
    This may result in a use after free bug, flush_old_exec() may
    "complete" vfork_done, which will wake up the parent which in turn
    may free the passed in filename.
    To fix this add a new tcomm field in struct linux_binprm which
    contains the now early generated task name until it is used.
    
    Fixes this bug on s390:

    Reported by lavish on IRC:
    If a suid/sgid binary did not learn any setuid/setgid call during learning,
    we would not any CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID capability to the task, nor
    any restrictions on uid/gid changes.  uid and gid can however be changed
    within a suid/sgid binary via setresuid/setresgid with ruid/rgid set to
    euid/egid.
    
    My fix:
    POSIX doesn't specify whether unprivileged users can perform the above
    setresuid/setresgid as an unprivileged user, though Linux has historically
    permitted them.  Modify this behavior when RBAC is enabled to require
    CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID for these operations.
    
    Thanks to Lavish for the report!

    proc: make sure mem_open() doesn't pin the target's memory
    
    Once /proc/pid/mem is opened, the memory can't be released until
    mem_release() even if its owner exits.
    
    Change mem_open() to do atomic_inc(mm_count) + mmput(), this only
    pins mm_struct. Change mem_rw() to do atomic_inc_not_zero(mm_count)
    before access_remote_vm(), this verifies that this mm is still alive.
    
    I am not sure what should mem_rw() return if atomic_inc_not_zero()
    fails. With this patch it returns zero to match the "mm == NULL" case,
    may be it should return -EINVAL like it did before e268337d.
    
    Perhaps it makes sense to add the additional fatal_signal_pending()
    check into the main loop, to ensure we do not hold this memory if
    the target task was oom-killed.

    eCryptfs: Infinite loop due to overflow in ecryptfs_write()
    
    ecryptfs_write() can enter an infinite loop when truncating a file to a
    size larger than 4G. This only happens on architectures where size_t is
    represented by 32 bits.
    
    This was caused by a size_t overflow due to it incorrectly being used to
    store the result of a calculation which uses potentially large values of
    type loff_t.

    eCryptfs: Check inode changes in setattr
    
    Most filesystems call inode_change_ok() very early in ->setattr(), but
    eCryptfs didn't call it at all. It allowed the lower filesystem to make
    the call in its ->setattr() function. Then, eCryptfs would copy the
    appropriate inode attributes from the lower inode to the eCryptfs inode.
    
    This patch changes that and actually calls inode_change_ok() on the
    eCryptfs inode, fairly early in ecryptfs_setattr(). Ideally, the call
    would happen earlier in ecryptfs_setattr(), but there are some possible
    inode initialization steps that must happen first.
    
    Since the call was already being made on the lower inode, the change in
    functionality should be minimal, except for the case of a file extending
    truncate call. In that case, inode_newsize_ok() was never being
    called on the eCryptfs inode. Rather than inode_newsize_ok() catching
    maximum file size errors early on, eCryptfs would encrypt zeroed pages
    and write them to the lower filesystem until the lower filesystem's
    write path caught the error in generic_write_checks(). This patch
    introduces a new function, called ecryptfs_inode_newsize_ok(), which
    checks if the new lower file size is within the appropriate limits when
    the truncate operation will be growing the lower file.
    
    In summary this change prevents eCryptfs truncate operations (and the
    resulting page encryptions), which would exceed the lower filesystem
    limits or FSIZE rlimits, from ever starting.

    eCryptfs: Make truncate path killable
    
    ecryptfs_write() handles the truncation of eCryptfs inodes. It grabs a
    page, zeroes out the appropriate portions, and then encrypts the page
    before writing it to the lower filesystem. It was unkillable and due to
    the lack of sparse file support could result in tying up a large portion
    of system resources, while encrypting pages of zeros, with no way for
    the truncate operation to be stopped from userspace.
    
    This patch adds the ability for ecryptfs_write() to detect a pending
    fatal signal and return as gracefully as possible. The intent is to
    leave the lower file in a useable state, while still allowing a user to
    break out of the encryption loop. If a pending fatal signal is detected,
    the eCryptfs inode size is updated to reflect the modified inode size
    and then -EINTR is returned.

    eCryptfs: Fix oops when printing debug info in extent crypto functions
    
    If pages passed to the eCryptfs extent-based crypto functions are not
    mapped and the module parameter ecryptfs_verbosity=1 was specified at
    loading time, a NULL pointer dereference will occur.
    
    Note that this wouldn't happen on a production system, as you wouldn't
    pass ecryptfs_verbosity=1 on a production system. It leaks private
    information to the system logs and is for debugging only.
    
    The debugging info printed in these messages is no longer very useful
    and rather than doing a kmap() in these debugging paths, it will be
    better to simply remove the debugging paths completely.

    eCryptfs: Sanitize write counts of /dev/ecryptfs
    
    A malicious count value specified when writing to /dev/ecryptfs may
    result in a a very large kernel memory allocation.
    
    This patch peeks at the specified packet payload size, adds that to the
    size of the packet headers and compares the result with the write count
    value. The resulting maximum memory allocation size is approximately 532
    bytes.

    Add two new features, one is automatic by enabling CONFIG_GRKERNSEC
    (may be changed if it breaks some userland), the other has its own
    config option
    
    First feature requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to write to any sysctl entry via
    the syscall or /proc/sys.
    
    Second feature requires read access to a suid/sgid binary in order
    to ptrace it, preventing infoleaking of binaries in situations where
    the admin has specified 4711 or 2711 perms.  Feature has been
    given the config option CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PTRACE_READEXEC and
    a sysctl entry of ptrace_readexec

    panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops
    
    When an oops causes a panic and panic prints another backtrace it's pretty
    common to have the original oops data be scrolled away on a 80x50 screen.
    
    The second backtrace is quite redundant and not needed anyways.
    
    So don't print the panic backtrace when oops_in_progress is true.

    block: fail SCSI passthrough ioctls on partition devices
    
    Linux allows executing the SG_IO ioctl on a partition or LVM volume, and
    will pass the command to the underlying block device.  This is
    well-known, but it is also a large security problem when (via Unix
    permissions, ACLs, SELinux or a combination thereof) a program or user
    needs to be granted access only to part of the disk.
    
    This patch lets partitions forward a small set of harmless ioctls;
    others are logged with printk so that we can see which ioctls are
    actually sent.  In my tests only CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY actually occurred.
    Of course it was being sent to a (partition on a) hard disk, so it would
    have failed with ENOTTY and the patch isn't changing anything in
    practice.  Still, I'm treating it specially to avoid spamming the logs.
    
    In principle, this restriction should include programs running with
    CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  If for example I let a program access /dev/sda2 and
    /dev/sdb, it still should not be able to read/write outside the
    boundaries of /dev/sda2 independent of the capabilities.  However, for
    now programs with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will still be allowed to send the
    ioctls.  Their actions will still be logged.
    
    This patch does not affect the non-libata IDE driver.  That driver
    however already tests for bd != bd->bd_contains before issuing some
    ioctl; it could be restricted further to forbid these ioctls even for
    programs running with CAP_SYS_ADMIN/CAP_SYS_RAWIO.

    audit: fix signedness bug in audit_log_execve_info()
    
    In the loop, a size_t "len" is used to hold the return value of
    audit_log_single_execve_arg(), which returns -1 on error.  In that
    case the error handling (len <= 0) will be bypassed since "len" is
    unsigned, and the loop continues with (p += len) being wrapped.
    Change the type of "len" to signed int to fix the error handling.
    
    	size_t len;
    	...
    	for (...) {

    nilfs2: potential integer overflow in nilfs_ioctl_clean_segments()
    
    There is a potential integer overflow in nilfs_ioctl_clean_segments().
    When a large argv[n].v_nmembs is passed from the userspace, the subsequent
    call to vmalloc() will allocate a buffer smaller than expected, which
    leads to out-of-bound access in nilfs_ioctl_move_blocks() and
    lfs_clean_segments().
    
    The following check does not prevent the overflow because nsegs is also
    controlled by the userspace and could be very large.
    
    		if (argv[n].v_nmembs > nsegs * nilfs->ns_blocks_per_segment)
    			goto out_free;
    
    This patch clamps argv[n].v_nmembs to UINT_MAX / argv[n].v_size, and
    returns -EINVAL when overflow.

    binary_sysctl(): fix memory leak
    
    binary_sysctl() calls sysctl_getname() which allocates from names_cache
    slab usin __getname()
    
    The matching function to free the name is __putname(), and not putname()
    which should be used only to match getname() allocations.
    
    This is because when auditing is enabled, putname() calls audit_putname
    *instead* (not in addition) to __putname().  Then, if a syscall is in
    progress, audit_putname does not release the name - instead, it expects
    the name to get released when the syscall completes, but that will happen
    only if audit_getname() was called previously, i.e.  if the name was
    allocated with getname() rather than the naked __getname().  So,
    __getname() followed by putname() ends up leaking memory.

    RDMA/cma: Verify private data length
    
    private_data_len is defined as a u8.  If the user specifies a large
    private_data size (> 220 bytes), we will calculate a total length that
    exceeds 255, resulting in private_data_len wrapping back to 0.  This
    can lead to overwriting random kernel memory.  Avoid this by verifying
    that the resulting size fits into a u8.

    sctp: fix incorrect overflow check on autoclose
    
    Commit 8ffd3208 voids the previous patches f6778aab and 810c0719 for
    limiting the autoclose value.  If userspace passes in -1 on 32-bit
    platform, the overflow check didn't work and autoclose would be set
    to 0xffffffff.
    
    This patch defines a max_autoclose (in seconds) for limiting the value
    and exposes it through sysctl, with the following intentions.
    
    1) Avoid overflowing autoclose * HZ.
    
    2) Keep the default autoclose bound consistent across 32- and 64-bit
       platforms (INT_MAX / HZ in this patch).
    
    3) Keep the autoclose value consistent between setsockopt() and
       getsockopt() calls.

    vmwgfx: fix incorrect VRAM size check in vmw_kms_fb_create()
    
    Commit e133e737 didn't correctly fix the integer overflow issue.
    
    -	unsigned int required_size;
    +	u64 required_size;
    	...
    	required_size = mode_cmd->pitch * mode_cmd->height;
    -	if (unlikely(required_size > dev_priv->vram_size)) {
    +	if (unlikely(required_size > (u64) dev_priv->vram_size)) {
    
    Note that both pitch and height are u32.  Their product is still u32 and
    would overflow before being assigned to required_size.  A correct way is
    to convert pitch and height to u64 before the multiplication.
    
    	required_size = (u64)mode_cmd->pitch * (u64)mode_cmd->height;
    
    This patch calls the existing vmw_kms_validate_mode_vram() for
    validation.

    rps: fix insufficient bounds checking in store_rps_dev_flow_table_cnt()
    
    Setting a large rps_flow_cnt like (1 << 30) on 32-bit platform will
    cause a kernel oops due to insufficient bounds checking.
    
    	if (count > 1<<30) {
    		/* Enforce a limit to prevent overflow */
    		return -EINVAL;
    	}
    	count = roundup_pow_of_two(count);
    	table = vmalloc(RPS_DEV_FLOW_TABLE_SIZE(count));
    
    Note that the macro RPS_DEV_FLOW_TABLE_SIZE(count) is defined as:
    
    	... + (count * sizeof(struct rps_dev_flow))
    
    where sizeof(struct rps_dev_flow) is 8.  (1 << 30) * 8 will overflow
    32 bits.
    
    This patch replaces the magic number (1 << 30) with a symbolic bound.

    permission check also happened to allow a case where a process retaining
    uid 0 could issue futex syscalls against other uid 0 tasks, despite the euid
    being non-zero (reported on forums by ben_w)

    Fix freeze reported by 'vs' on the forums.  Bug occurred due to
    MAY_NOT_BLOCK added to Linux 3.1.  Our logging code, when a capability used
    in generic_permission() was in the task's effective set but disallowed by
    RBAC, would block when acquiring locks resulting in the freeze.
    
    Also update the ordering of checks so that CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH isn't logged
    as being required when CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is present (consistent with
    older patches).

    sctp: better integer overflow check in sctp_auth_create_key()
    
    The check from commit 30c2235c is incomplete and cannot prevent
    cases like key_len = 0x80000000 (INT_MAX + 1).  In that case, the
    left-hand side of the check (INT_MAX - key_len), which is unsigned,
    becomes 0xffffffff (UINT_MAX) and bypasses the check.
    
    However this shouldn't be a security issue.  The function is called
    from the following two code paths:
    
     1) setsockopt()
    
     2) sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret()
    
    In case (1), sca_keylength is never going to exceed 65535 since it's
    bounded by a u16 from the user API.  As such, the key length will
    never overflow.
    
    In case (2), sca_keylength is computed based on the user key (1 short)
    and 2 * key_vector (3 shorts) for a total of 7 * USHRT_MAX, which still
    will not overflow.
    
    In other words, this overflow check is not really necessary.  Just
    make it more correct.

    fs/minix: Verify bitmap block counts before mounting
    
    Newer versions of MINIX can create filesystems that allocate an extra
    bitmap block.  Mounting of this succeeds, but doing a statfs call will
    result in an oops in count_free because of a negative number being used
    for the bh index.
    
    Avoid this by verifying the number of allocated blocks at mount time,
    erroring out if there are not enough and make statfs ignore the extras
    if there are too many.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18792
