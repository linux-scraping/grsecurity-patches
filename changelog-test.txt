    Only further restrict futex targeting another process -- our modified
    permission check also happened to allow a case where a process retaining
    uid 0 could issue futex syscalls against other uid 0 tasks, despite the euid
    being non-zero (reported on forums by ben_w)

    Fix freeze reported by 'vs' on the forums.  Bug occurred due to
    MAY_NOT_BLOCK added to Linux 3.1.  Our logging code, when a capability used
    in generic_permission() was in the task's effective set but disallowed by
    RBAC, would block when acquiring locks resulting in the freeze.
    
    Also update the ordering of checks so that CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH isn't logged
    as being required when CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is present (consistent with
    older patches).

    sctp: better integer overflow check in sctp_auth_create_key()
    
    The check from commit 30c2235c is incomplete and cannot prevent
    cases like key_len = 0x80000000 (INT_MAX + 1).  In that case, the
    left-hand side of the check (INT_MAX - key_len), which is unsigned,
    becomes 0xffffffff (UINT_MAX) and bypasses the check.
    
    However this shouldn't be a security issue.  The function is called
    from the following two code paths:
    
     1) setsockopt()
    
     2) sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret()
    
    In case (1), sca_keylength is never going to exceed 65535 since it's
    bounded by a u16 from the user API.  As such, the key length will
    never overflow.
    
    In case (2), sca_keylength is computed based on the user key (1 short)
    and 2 * key_vector (3 shorts) for a total of 7 * USHRT_MAX, which still
    will not overflow.
    
    In other words, this overflow check is not really necessary.  Just
    make it more correct.

    fs/minix: Verify bitmap block counts before mounting
    
    Newer versions of MINIX can create filesystems that allocate an extra
    bitmap block.  Mounting of this succeeds, but doing a statfs call will
    result in an oops in count_free because of a negative number being used
    for the bh index.
    
    Avoid this by verifying the number of allocated blocks at mount time,
    erroring out if there are not enough and make statfs ignore the extras
    if there are too many.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18792
