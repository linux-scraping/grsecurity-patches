    bonding: remove sysfs before removing devices
    
    We have a race condition if we try to rmmod bonding and simultaneously add
    a bond master through sysfs. In bonding_exit() we first remove the devices
    (through rtnl_link_unregister() ) and only after that we remove the sysfs.
    If we manage to add a device through sysfs after that the devices were
    removed - we'll end up with that device/sysfs structure and with the module
    unloaded.
    
    Fix this by first removing the sysfs and only after that calling
    rtnl_link_unregister().

    This reverts commit 14134f6584212d585b310ce95428014b653dfaf6.
    
    The problem that the above patch was meant to address is that af_unix
    messages are not being coallesced because we are sending unnecesarry
    credentials.  Not sending credentials in maybe_add_creds totally
    breaks unconnected unix domain sockets that wish to send credentails
    to other sockets.
    
    In practice this break some versions of udev because they receive a
    message and the sending uid is bogus so they drop the message.

    af_unix: If we don't care about credentials coallesce all messages
    
    It was reported that the following LSB test case failed
    https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=2144 because we
    were not coallescing unix stream messages when the application was
    expecting us to.
    
    The problem was that the first send was before the socket was accepted
    and thus sock->sk_socket was NULL in maybe_add_creds, and the second
    send after the socket was accepted had a non-NULL value for sk->socket
    and thus we could tell the credentials were not needed so we did not
    bother.
    
    The unnecessary credentials on the first message cause
    unix_stream_recvmsg to start verifying that all messages had the same
    credentials before coallescing and then the coallescing failed because
    the second message had no credentials.
    
    Ignoring credentials when we don't care in unix_stream_recvmsg fixes a
    long standing pessimization which would fail to coallesce messages when
    reading from a unix stream socket if the senders were different even if
    we did not care about their credentials.
    
    I have tested this and verified that the in the LSB test case mentioned
    above that the messages do coallesce now, while the were failing to
    coallesce without this change.

    unix: fix a race condition in unix_release()
    
    As reported by Jan, and others over the past few years, there is a
    race condition caused by unix_release setting the sock->sk pointer
    to NULL before properly marking the socket as dead/orphaned.  This
    can cause a problem with the LSM hook security_unix_may_send() if
    there is another socket attempting to write to this partially
    released socket in between when sock->sk is set to NULL and it is
    marked as dead/orphaned.  This patch fixes this by only setting
    sock->sk to NULL after the socket has been marked as dead; I also
    take the opportunity to make unix_release_sock() a void function
    as it only ever returned 0/success.
    
    Dave, I think this one should go on the -stable pile.
    
    Special thanks to Jan for coming up with a reproducer for this
    problem.

    Btrfs: don't drop path when printing out tree errors in scrub
    
    A user reported a panic where we were panicing somewhere in
    tree_backref_for_extent from scrub_print_warning.  He only captured the trace
    but looking at scrub_print_warning we drop the path right before we mess with
    the extent buffer to print out a bunch of stuff, which isn't right.  So fix this
    by dropping the path after we use the eb if we need to.  Thanks,

    reiserfs: Fix warning and inode leak when deleting inode with xattrs
    
    After commit 21d8a15a (lookup_one_len: don't accept . and ..) reiserfs
    started failing to delete xattrs from inode. This was due to a buggy
    test for '.' and '..' in fill_with_dentries() which resulted in passing
    '.' and '..' entries to lookup_one_len() in some cases. That returned
    error and so we failed to iterate over all xattrs of and inode.
    
    Fix the test in fill_with_dentries() along the lines of the one in
    lookup_one_len().

    Another infoleak, up to 128 bytes on the stack in __sys_recvmsg
    takes user-provided length, copies up to that amount in a sockaddr_storage
    struct on the stack, then takes an upper-bounded-only user-provided length
    and copies the sockaddr_storage struct back out to userland, complete with
    uninitialized data

    Update to pax-linux-3.2.42-test97.patch:
     fixed kprobes problem under KERNEXEC/i386, reported by Emese Revfy
    - fixed arm compilation problems reported by Michael Tremer
    - the constify plugin got smarter that enabled, with some additional patching,
      the elimination of about half the static function pointers on amd64/allmod
      (up from about 18%), depending on the kernel config it can be even more (70%)
    - fixed too strict mmap parameter checking on i386, reported by browndav (http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3339)
    - small latent entropy improvement: pass pax_extra_latent_entropy to the kernel to extract entropy from RAM content during boot
    - adjusted RLIMIT_AS accounting for the extra ASLR gap mappings, reported by Alexander Stoll (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=459268)
    - changed debian packager rules to include the compiler plugins, from Tyler Coumbes <coumbes@gmail.com>
    - fixed the sa_restorer leak discovered and reported by Emese Revfy (CVE-2013-0914, google chromium bug #177956)
    - new size overflow plugin from Emese that instruments a whole lot more code due to tracking function return values
      and more type casts as well. this found the above mentioned sa_restorer leak and would have protected against CVE-2013-0913.
    - added a small sanity check to kfree (spender's idea)
    - fixed a size overflow false positive (well, not really, it's bad zlib code) reported by slashbeast on irc
    - fixed ptrace compat bug found by the size overflow plugin
    - fixed perf compilation reported by Michael Tremer
    - fixed USERCOPY reports triggered by SCTP, reported by Marc Schiffbauer (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919315#c11)
    - fixed bug with the old PAGEEXEC method and hugetlb, reported by Alex Efros (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=437722)
    - added a new gcc plugin to plug (pun intended) some of the kernel stack leaks to userland

    Fix 8-byte stack infoleak in ia32_rt_sigpending
    User controls length, kernel only performs check on the upper bound, will
    fill in any amount less than sizeof(sigset_t) via a copy_to_user under
    KERNEL_DS in sys_rt_sigpending, then will copy the full size of compat_sigset_t
    regardless of whether the sigset_t content copied into it has been initialized
    or not

    commit 95a69adab9acfc3981c504737a2b6578e4d846ef upstream.
    
    The source code without this patch caused hypervkvpd to exit when it processed
    a spoofed Netlink packet which has been sent from an untrusted local user.
    Now Netlink messages with a non-zero nl_pid source address are ignored
    and a warning is printed into the syslog.

        nfsd4: reject "negative" acl lengths
    
        Since we only enforce an upper bound, not a lower bound, a "negative"
        length can get through here.
    
        The symptom seen was a warning when we attempt to a kmalloc with an
        excessive size.

    Upstream commit: f853c616883a8de966873a1dab283f1369e275a1
    
    cifs: ignore everything in SPNEGO blob after mechTypes
    
    We've had several reports of people attempting to mount Windows 8 shares
    and getting failures with a return code of -EINVAL. The default sec=
    mode changed recently to sec=ntlmssp. With that, we expect and parse a
    SPNEGO blob from the server in the NEGOTIATE reply.
    
    The current decode_negTokenInit function first parses all of the
    mechTypes and then tries to parse the rest of the negTokenInit reply.
    The parser however currently expects a mechListMIC or nothing to follow the
    mechTypes, but Windows 8 puts a mechToken field there instead to carry
    some info for the new NegoEx stuff.
    
    In practice, we don't do anything with the fields after the mechTypes
    anyway so I don't see any real benefit in continuing to parse them.
    This patch just has the kernel ignore the fields after the mechTypes.
    We'll probably need to reinstate some of this if we ever want to support
    NegoEx.

    Umm...  I see what you are describing, and AFAICS you are correct; let me
    see if I am misreading your analysis:
            * vfsmount_lock may act fair; A holding it shared, with B spinning
    on attempt to take it exclusive may lead to C spinning on attempt to take
    it shared.
            * path_is_under() tries get rename_lock while holding vfsmount_lock
    shared.
            * d_path() et.al. try to take vfsmount_lock shared, while holding
    rename_lock.
    
    All true and yes, it's a bug (I'd probably classify it as a livelock, but
    that doesn't make any real difference).  There are three possible solutions,
    AFAICS:
            1) two-liner in path_is_under() replacing the use of vfsmount_lock
    with that of namespace_sem; trivial, but results in function unexpectedly
    blocking.  The current callers are fine with that, but it's a trouble
    waiting to happen.
            2) replace write_seqlock() in prepend_path() callers with
    read_seqbegin/read_seqretry loops; bigger and more brittle, since unlike
    is_subdir() we need more than just ->d_parent not pointing to something
    freed - we also care about ->d_name.len being in sync with ->d_name.name.
    It probably can be worked around, but...
    
            3) declare that rename_lock nests inside vfsmount_lock and let
    the callers of prepend_path() take vfsmount_lock().  I'd probably prefer
    that one...

    mm: account the total_vm in the vm_stat_account()
    
    vm_stat_account() accounts the shared_vm, stack_vm and reserved_vm now.
    But we can also account for total_vm in the vm_stat_account() which makes
    the code tidy.
    
    Even for mprotect_fixup(), we can get the right result in the end.

    KVM: x86: fix for buffer overflow in handling of MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME (CVE-2013-1796)
    
    If the guest sets the GPA of the time_page so that the request to update the
    time straddles a page then KVM will write onto an incorrect page.  The
    write is done byusing kmap atomic to get a pointer to the page for the time
    structure and then performing a memcpy to that page starting at an offset
    that the guest controls.  Well behaved guests always provide a 32-byte aligned
    address, however a malicious guest could use this to corrupt host kernel
    memory.
    
    Tested: Tested against kvmclock unit test.

    KVM: Fix bounds checking in ioapic indirect register reads (CVE-2013-1798)
    
    If the guest specifies a IOAPIC_REG_SELECT with an invalid value and follows
    that with a read of the IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW KVM does not properly validate
    that request.  ioapic_read_indirect contains an
    ASSERT(redir_index < IOAPIC_NUM_PINS), but the ASSERT has no effect in
    non-debug builds.  In recent kernels this allows a guest to cause a kernel
    oops by reading invalid memory.  In older kernels (pre-3.3) this allows a
    guest to read from large ranges of host memory.
    
    Tested: tested against apic unit tests.

    ext3: Fix format string issues
    
    ext3_msg() takes the printk prefix as the second parameter and the
    format string as the third parameter. Two callers of ext3_msg omit the
    prefix and pass the format string as the second parameter and the first
    parameter to the format string as the third parameter. In both cases
    this string comes from an arbitrary source. Which means the string may
    contain format string characters, which will
    lead to undefined and potentially harmful behavior.
    
    The issue was introduced in commit 4cf46b67eb("ext3: Unify log messages
    in ext3") and is fixed by this patch.

    hw_random: make buffer usable in scatterlist.
    
    virtio_rng feeds the randomness buffer handed by the core directly
    into the scatterlist, since commit bb347d98079a547e80bd4722dee1de61e4dca0e8.
    
    However, if CONFIG_HW_RANDOM=m, the static buffer isn't a linear address
    (at least on most archs).  We could fix this in virtio_rng, but it's actually
    far easier to just do it in the core as virtio_rng would have to allocate
    a buffer every time (it doesn't know how much the core will want to read).

    When walking down the path on the server, it's possible to hit a
    symlink. The path walking code assumes that the caller will handle that
    situation properly, but cifs_get_root() isn't set up for it. This patch
    prevents the oops by simply returning an error.
    
    A better solution would be to try and chase the symlinks here, but that's
    fairly complicated to handle.

    Upstream commit: 8aec0f5d4137532de14e6554fd5dd201ff3a3c49
    
    Fix: compat_rw_copy_check_uvector() misuse in aio, readv, writev, and security keys
    
    Looking at mm/process_vm_access.c:process_vm_rw() and comparing it to
    compat_process_vm_rw() shows that the compatibility code requires an
    explicit "access_ok()" check before calling
    compat_rw_copy_check_uvector(). The same difference seems to appear when
    we compare fs/read_write.c:do_readv_writev() to
    fs/compat.c:compat_do_readv_writev().
    
    This subtle difference between the compat and non-compat requirements
    should probably be debated, as it seems to be error-prone. In fact,
    there are two others sites that use this function in the Linux kernel,
    and they both seem to get it wrong:
    
    Now shifting our attention to fs/aio.c, we see that aio_setup_iocb()
    also ends up calling compat_rw_copy_check_uvector() through
    aio_setup_vectored_rw(). Unfortunately, the access_ok() check appears to
    be missing. Same situation for
    security/keys/compat.c:compat_keyctl_instantiate_key_iov().
    
    I propose that we add the access_ok() check directly into
    compat_rw_copy_check_uvector(), so callers don't have to worry about it,
    and it therefore makes the compat call code similar to its non-compat
    counterpart. Place the access_ok() check in the same location where
    copy_from_user() can trigger a -EFAULT error in the non-compat code, so
    the ABI behaviors are alike on both compat and non-compat.
    
    While we are here, fix compat_do_readv_writev() so it checks for
    compat_rw_copy_check_uvector() negative return values.
    
    And also, fix a memory leak in compat_keyctl_instantiate_key_iov() error
    handling.

    vfs: fix pipe counter breakage
    
    If you open a pipe for neither read nor write, the pipe code will not
    add any usage counters to the pipe, causing the 'struct pipe_inode_info"
    to be potentially released early.
    
    That doesn't normally matter, since you cannot actually use the pipe,
    but the pipe release code - particularly fasync handling - still expects
    the actual pipe infrastructure to all be there.  And rather than adding
    NULL pointer checks, let's just disallow this case, the same way we
    already do for the named pipe ("fifo") case.
    
    This is ancient going back to pre-2.4 days, and until trinity, nobody
    naver noticed.

    Initialize the mac address buffer with 0 as the driver specific function
    will probably not fill the whole buffer. In fact, all in-kernel drivers
    fill only ETH_ALEN of the MAX_ADDR_LEN bytes, i.e. 6 of the 32 possible
    bytes. Therefore we currently leak 26 bytes of stack memory to userland
    via the netlink interface.

    Date: Sat,  9 Mar 2013 16:52:21 +0100
    
    The dcb netlink interface leaks stack memory in various places:
    * perm_addr[] buffer is only filled at max with 12 of the 32 bytes but
      copied completely,
    * no in-kernel driver fills all fields of an IEEE 802.1Qaz subcommand,
      so we're leaking up to 58 bytes for ieee_ets structs, up to 136 bytes
      for ieee_pfc structs, etc.,
    * the same is true for CEE -- no in-kernel driver fills the whole
      struct,
    
    Prevent all of the above stack info leaks by properly initializing the
    buffers/structures involved.

    l2tp: Restore socket refcount when sendmsg succeeds
    
    The sendmsg() syscall handler for PPPoL2TP doesn't decrease the socket
    reference counter after successful transmissions. Any successful
    sendmsg() call from userspace will then increase the reference counter
    forever, thus preventing the kernel's session and tunnel data from
    being freed later on.
    
    The problem only happens when writing directly on L2TP sockets.
    PPP sockets attached to L2TP are unaffected as the PPP subsystem
    uses pppol2tp_xmit() which symmetrically increase/decrease reference
    counters.
    
    This patch adds the missing call to sock_put() before returning from
    pppol2tp_sendmsg().

    mm: do not grow the stack vma just because of an overrun on preceding vma
    
    The stack vma is designed to grow automatically (marked with VM_GROWSUP
    or VM_GROWSDOWN depending on architecture) when an access is made beyond
    the existing boundary.  However, particularly if you have not limited
    your stack at all ("ulimit -s unlimited"), this can cause the stack to
    grow even if the access was really just one past *another* segment.
    
    And that's wrong, especially since we first grow the segment, but then
    immediately later enforce the stack guard page on the last page of the
    segment.  So _despite_ first growing the stack segment as a result of
    the access, the kernel will then make the access cause a SIGSEGV anyway!
    
    So do the same logic as the guard page check does, and consider an
    access to within one page of the next segment to be a bad access, rather
    than growing the stack to abut the next segment.

    Upstream commit: 7c10093692ed2e6f318387d96b829320aa0ca64c
    
    x86: Make sure we can boot in the case the BDA contains pure garbage
    
    On non-BIOS platforms it is possible that the BIOS data area contains
    garbage instead of being zeroed or something equivalent (firmware
    people: we are talking of 1.5K here, so please do the sane thing.)
    
    We need on the order of 20-30K of low memory in order to boot, which
    may grow up to < 64K in the future.  We probably want to avoid the
    lowest of the low memory.  At the same time, it seems extremely
    unlikely that a legitimate EBDA would ever reach down to the 128K
    (which would require it to be over half a megabyte in size.)  Thus,
    pick 128K as the cutoff for "this is insane, ignore."  We may still
    end up reserving a bunch of extra memory on the low megabyte, but that
    is not really a major issue these days.  In the worst case we lose
    512K of RAM.
    
    This code really should be merged with trim_bios_range() in
    arch/x86/kernel/setup.c, but that is a bigger patch for a later merge
    window.

    Bluetooth: Fix incorrect strncpy() in hidp_setup_hid()
    
    The length parameter should be sizeof(req->name) - 1 because there is no
    guarantee that string provided by userspace will contain the trailing
    '\0'.
    
    Can be easily reproduced by manually setting req->name to 128 non-zero
    bytes prior to ioctl(HIDPCONNADD) and checking the device name setup on
    input subsystem:
    
    $ cat /sys/devices/pnp0/00\:04/tty/ttyS0/hci0/hci0\:1/input8/name
    AAAAAA[...]AAAAAAAAf0:af:f0:af:f0:af
    
    ("f0:af:f0:af:f0:af" is the device bluetooth address, taken from "phys"
    field in struct hid_device due to overflow.)

    NLS: improve UTF8 -> UTF16 string conversion routine
    
    The utf8s_to_utf16s conversion routine needs to be improved.  Unlike
    its utf16s_to_utf8s sibling, it doesn't accept arguments specifying
    the maximum length of the output buffer or the endianness of its
    16-bit output.
    
    This patch (as1501) adds the two missing arguments, and adjusts the
    only two places in the kernel where the function is called.  A
    follow-on patch will add a third caller that does utilize the new
    capabilities.
    
    The two conversion routines are still annoyingly inconsistent in the
    way they handle invalid byte combinations.  But that's a subject for a
    different patch.

    tmpfs: fix use-after-free of mempolicy object
    
    The tmpfs remount logic preserves filesystem mempolicy if the mpol=M
    option is not specified in the remount request.  A new policy can be
    specified if mpol=M is given.
    
    Before this patch remounting an mpol bound tmpfs without specifying
    mpol= mount option in the remount request would set the filesystem's
    mempolicy object to a freed mempolicy object.
    
    To reproduce the problem boot a DEBUG_PAGEALLOC kernel and run:
        # mkdir /tmp/x
    
        # mount -t tmpfs -o size=100M,mpol=interleave nodev /tmp/x
    
        # grep /tmp/x /proc/mounts
        nodev /tmp/x tmpfs rw,relatime,size=102400k,mpol=interleave:0-3 0 0
    
        # mount -o remount,size=200M nodev /tmp/x
    
        # grep /tmp/x /proc/mounts
        nodev /tmp/x tmpfs rw,relatime,size=204800k,mpol=??? 0 0
            # note ? garbage in mpol=... output above
    
        # dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/x/f count=1
            # panic here
    
    Panic:
        BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at           (null)
        IP: [<          (null)>]           (null)

          cstar_dispatch+0x7/0x1f
    
    Non-debug kernels will not crash immediately because referencing the
    dangling mpol will not cause a fault.  Instead the filesystem will
    reference a freed mempolicy object, which will cause unpredictable
    behavior.
    
    The problem boils down to a dropped mpol reference below if
    shmem_parse_options() does not allocate a new mpol:
    
        config = *sbinfo
        shmem_parse_options(data, &config, true)
        mpol_put(sbinfo->mpol)
        sbinfo->mpol = config.mpol  /* BUG: saves unreferenced mpol */
    
    This patch avoids the crash by not releasing the mempolicy if
    shmem_parse_options() doesn't create a new mpol.
    
    How far back does this issue go? I see it in both 2.6.36 and 3.3.  I did
    not look back further.

commit 583fdbb82026b27d4c81a4d968a07d464ee08b11
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 18 09:58:02 2013 -0800

    Upstream commit: 7c45512df987c5619db041b5c9b80d281e26d3db
    
    mm: fix pageblock bitmap allocation
    
    Commit c060f943d092 ("mm: use aligned zone start for pfn_to_bitidx
    calculation") fixed out calculation of the index into the pageblock
    bitmap when a !SPARSEMEM zome was not aligned to pageblock_nr_pages.
    
    However, the _allocation_ of that bitmap had never taken this alignment
    requirement into accout, so depending on the exact size and alignment of
    the zone, the use of that index could then access past the allocation,
    resulting in some very subtle memory corruption.
    
    This was reported (and bisected) by Ingo Molnar: one of his random
    config builds would hang with certain very specific kernel command line
    options.
    
    In the meantime, commit c060f943d092 has been marked for stable, so this
    fix needs to be back-ported to the stable kernels that backported the
    commit to use the right alignment.

    Subject: [PATCHv2 2/3] crypto: user - fix empty string test in report API
    
    The current test for empty strings fails because it is testing the
    address of a field, not a pointer. So the test will always be true.
    Test the first character in the string to not be null instead.

    Subject: [PATCHv2 1/3] crypto: user - fix info leaks in report API
    
    Three errors resulting in kernel memory disclosure:
    
    1/ The structures used for the netlink based crypto algorithm report API
    are located on the stack. As snprintf() does not fill the remainder of
    the buffer with null bytes, those stack bytes will be disclosed to users
    of the API. Switch to strncpy() to fix this.
    
    2/ crypto_report_one() does not initialize all field of struct
    crypto_user_alg. Fix this to fix the heap info leak.
    
    3/ For the module name we should copy only as many bytes as
    module_name() returns -- not as much as the destination buffer could
    hold. But the current code does not and therefore copies random data
    from behind the end of the module name, as the module name is always
    shorter than CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME.
    
    Also switch to use strncpy() to copy the algorithm's name and
    driver_name. They are strings, after all.

    Petr says: "
     I've analysed the bug and I think that xen_iret() cannot cope with
     mangled DS, in this case zeroed out (null selector/descriptor) by either
     xen_failsafe_callback() or RESTORE_REGS because the corresponding LDT
     entry was invalidated by the reproducer. "
    
    Jan took a look at the preliminary patch and came up a fix that solves
    this problem:
    
    "This code gets called after all registers other than those handled by
    IRET got already restored, hence a null selector in %ds or a non-null
    one that got loaded from a code or read-only data descriptor would
    cause a kernel mode fault (with the potential of crashing the kernel
    as a whole, if panic_on_oops is set)."
    
    The way to fix this is to realize that the we can only relay on the
    registers that IRET restores. The two that are guaranteed are the
    %cs and %ss as they are always fixed GDT selectors. Also they are
    inaccessible from user mode - so they cannot be altered. This is
    the approach taken in this patch.
    
    Another alternative option suggested by Jan would be to relay on
    the subtle realization that using the %ebp or %esp relative references uses
    the %ss segment.  In which case we could switch from using %eax to %ebp and
    would not need the %ss over-rides. That would also require one extra
    instruction to compensate for the one place where the register is used
    as scaled index. However Andrew pointed out that is too subtle and if
    further work was to be done in this code-path it could escape folks attention
    and lead to accidents.

    ptrace: introduce signal_wake_up_state() and ptrace_signal_wake_up()
    
    Cleanup and preparation for the next change.
    
    signal_wake_up(resume => true) is overused. None of ptrace/jctl callers
    actually want to wakeup a TASK_WAKEKILL task, but they can't specify the
    necessary mask.
    
    Turn signal_wake_up() into signal_wake_up_state(state), reintroduce
    signal_wake_up() as a trivial helper, and add ptrace_signal_wake_up()
    which adds __TASK_TRACED.
    
    This way ptrace_signal_wake_up() can work "inside" ptrace_request()
    even if the tracee doesn't have the TASK_WAKEKILL bit set.

    x86/mm: Check if PUD is large when validating a kernel address
    
    A user reported the following oops when a backup process reads
    /proc/kcore:
    
     BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffbb00ff33b000
     IP: [<ffffffff8103157e>] kern_addr_valid+0xbe/0x110
     [...]
    
     Call Trace:
      [<ffffffff811b8aaa>] read_kcore+0x17a/0x370
      [<ffffffff811ad847>] proc_reg_read+0x77/0xc0
      [<ffffffff81151687>] vfs_read+0xc7/0x130
      [<ffffffff811517f3>] sys_read+0x53/0xa0
      [<ffffffff81449692>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
    
    Investigation determined that the bug triggered when reading
    system RAM at the 4G mark. On this system, that was the first
    address using 1G pages for the virt->phys direct mapping so the
    PUD is pointing to a physical address, not a PMD page.
    
    The problem is that the page table walker in kern_addr_valid() is
    not checking pud_large() and treats the physical address as if
    it was a PMD.  If it happens to look like pmd_none then it'll
    silently fail, probably returning zeros instead of real data. If
    the data happens to look like a present PMD though, it will be
    walked resulting in the oops above.
    
    This patch adds the necessary pud_large() check.
    
    Unfortunately the problem was not readily reproducible and now
    they are running the backup program without accessing
    /proc/kcore so the patch has not been validated but I think it
    makes sense.

    packet: fix leakage of tx_ring memory
    
    When releasing a packet socket, the routine packet_set_ring() is reused
    to free rings instead of allocating them. But when calling it for the
    first time, it fills req->tp_block_nr with the value of rb->pg_vec_len
    which in the second invocation makes it bail out since req->tp_block_nr
    is greater zero but req->tp_block_size is zero.
    
    This patch solves the problem by passing a zeroed auto-variable to
    packet_set_ring() upon each invocation from packet_release().
    
    As far as I can tell, this issue exists even since 69e3c75 (net: TX_RING
    and packet mmap), i.e. the original inclusion of TX ring support into
    af_packet, but applies only to sockets with both RX and TX ring
    allocated, which is probably why this was unnoticed all the time.

    A device sending 0 length frames as fast as it can has been

    pressure.
    
    Temporarily disable RX skb allocation and URB submission when
    the current error ratio is high, preventing us from trying to
    allocate an infinite number of skbs.  Reenable as soon as we
    are finished processing the done queue, allowing the device
    to continue working after short error bursts.

    Upstream commit: c903f0456bc69176912dee6dd25c6a66ee1aed00
    
    x86/msr: Add capabilities check
    
    At the moment the MSR driver only relies upon file system
    checks. This means that anything as root with any capability set
    can write to MSRs. Historically that wasn't very interesting but
    on modern processors the MSRs are such that writing to them
    provides several ways to execute arbitary code in kernel space.
    Sample code and documentation on doing this is circulating and
    MSR attacks are used on Windows 64bit rootkits already.
    
    In the Linux case you still need to be able to open the device
    file so the impact is fairly limited and reduces the security of
    some capability and security model based systems down towards
    that of a generic "root owns the box" setup.
    
    Therefore they should require CAP_SYS_RAWIO to prevent an
    elevation of capabilities. The impact of this is fairly minimal
    on most setups because they don't have heavy use of
    capabilities. Those using SELinux, SMACK or AppArmor rules might
    want to consider if their rulesets on the MSR driver could be
    tighter.

    Upstream commit: c1bf08ac26e92122faab9f6c32ea8aba94612dae
    
    ftrace: Be first to run code modification on modules
    
    If some other kernel subsystem has a module notifier, and adds a kprobe
    to a ftrace mcount point (now that kprobes work on ftrace points),
    when the ftrace notifier runs it will fail and disable ftrace, as well
    as kprobes that are attached to ftrace points.
    
    Here's the error:

     ftrace failed to modify [<ffffffffa0180000>] init_once+0x0/0x20 [fat]
      actual: cc:bb:d2:4b:e1
    
    A kprobe was added to the init_once() function in the fat module on load.
    But this happened before ftrace could have touched the code. As ftrace
    didn't run yet, the kprobe system had no idea it was a ftrace point and
    simply added a breakpoint to the code (0xcc in the cc:bb:d2:4b:e1).
    
    Then when ftrace went to modify the location from a call to mcount/fentry
    into a nop, it didn't see a call op, but instead it saw the breakpoint op
    and not knowing what to do with it, ftrace shut itself down.
    
    The solution is to simply give the ftrace module notifier the max priority.
    This should have been done regardless, as the core code ftrace modification
    also happens very early on in boot up. This makes the module modification
    closer to core modification.

    Upstream commit: 9899d11f654474d2d54ea52ceaa2a1f4db3abd68
    
    ptrace: ensure arch_ptrace/ptrace_request can never race with SIGKILL
    
    putreg() assumes that the tracee is not running and pt_regs_access() can
    safely play with its stack.  However a killed tracee can return from
    ptrace_stop() to the low-level asm code and do RESTORE_REST, this means
    that debugger can actually read/modify the kernel stack until the tracee
    does SAVE_REST again.
    
    set_task_blockstep() can race with SIGKILL too and in some sense this
    race is even worse, the very fact the tracee can be woken up breaks the
    logic.
    
    As Linus suggested we can clear TASK_WAKEKILL around the arch_ptrace()
    call, this ensures that nobody can ever wakeup the tracee while the
    debugger looks at it.  Not only this fixes the mentioned problems, we
    can do some cleanups/simplifications in arch_ptrace() paths.
    
    Probably ptrace_unfreeze_traced() needs more callers, for example it
    makes sense to make the tracee killable for oom-killer before
    access_process_vm().
    
    While at it, add the comment into may_ptrace_stop() to explain why
    ptrace_stop() still can't rely on SIGKILL and signal_pending_state().

    wake_up_process() should never wakeup a TASK_STOPPED/TRACED task.
    Change it to use TASK_NORMAL and add the WARN_ON().
    
    TASK_ALL has no other users, probably can be killed.

    Upstream commit: 6d92d4f6a74766cc885b18218268e0c47fbca399
    
    fs/exec.c: work around icc miscompilation
    
    The tricky problem is this check:
    
    	if (i++ >= max)
    
    icc (mis)optimizes this check as:
    
    	if (++i > max)
    
    The check now becomes a no-op since max is MAX_ARG_STRINGS (0x7FFFFFFF).
    
    This is "allowed" by the C standard, assuming i++ never overflows,
    because signed integer overflow is undefined behavior.  This
    optimization effectively reverts the previous commit 362e6663ef23
    ("exec.c, compat.c: fix count(), compat_count() bounds checking") that
    tries to fix the check.
    
    This patch simply moves ++ after the check.

    Add a feature from Willy Tarreau to disable TCP Simultaneous Connect.
    I've eliminated the sysctl and enabled the feature by default
    in all automatic configurations.
    
    Willy's original commit message is below:
    
    >From 61abc5ef6c3bc210c63036b5f36cc96a7802b605 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
    From: Willy Tarreau <w@1wt.eu>
    Date: Wed, 8 Oct 2008 10:00:42 +0200
    Subject: [PATCH] TCP: add a sysctl to disable simultaneous connection opening.
    
    Strict implementation of RFC793 (TCP) requires support for a feature
    called "simultaneous connect", which allows two clients to connect to
    each other without anyone entering a listening state.  While almost
    never used, and supported by few OSes, Linux supports this feature.
    
    However, it introduces a weakness in the protocol which makes it very
    easy for an attacker to prevent a client from connecting to a known
    server. The attacker only has to guess the source port to shut down
    the client connection during its establishment. The impact is limited,
    but it may be used to prevent an antivirus or IPS from fetching updates
    and not detecting an attack, or to prevent an SSL gateway from fetching
    a CRL for example.
    
    This patch provides a new sysctl "tcp_simult_connect" to enable or disable
    support for this useless feature. It comes disabled by default.
    
    Hundreds of systems running with that feature disabled for more than 4 years
    have never encountered an application which requires it. It is almost never
    supported by firewalls BTW.

    Upstream commit: f2a07f40dbc603c15f8b06e6ec7f768af67b424f
    
    tmpfs mempolicy: fix /proc/mounts corrupting memory
    
    Recently I suggested using "mount -o remount,mpol=local /tmp" in NUMA
    mempolicy testing.  Very nasty.  Reading /proc/mounts, /proc/pid/mounts
    or /proc/pid/mountinfo may then corrupt one bit of kernel memory, often
    in a page table (causing "Bad swap" or "Bad page map" warning or "Bad
    pagetable" oops), sometimes in a vm_area_struct or rbnode or somewhere
    worse.  "mpol=prefer" and "mpol=prefer:Node" are equally toxic.
    
    Recent NUMA enhancements are not to blame: this dates back to 2.6.35,
    when commit e17f74af351c "mempolicy: don't call mpol_set_nodemask() when
    no_context" skipped mpol_parse_str()'s call to mpol_set_nodemask(),
    which used to initialize v.preferred_node, or set MPOL_F_LOCAL in flags.
    With slab poisoning, you can then rely on mpol_to_str() to set the bit
    for node 0x6b6b, probably in the next page above the caller's stack.
    
    mpol_parse_str() is only called from shmem_parse_options(): no_context
    is always true, so call it unused for now, and remove !no_context code.
    Set v.nodes or v.preferred_node or MPOL_F_LOCAL as mpol_to_str() might
    expect.  Then mpol_to_str() can ignore its no_context argument also,
    the mpol being appropriately initialized whether contextualized or not.
    Rename its no_context unused too, and let subsequent patch remove them
    (that's not needed for stable backporting, which would involve rejects).
    
    I don't understand why MPOL_LOCAL is described as a pseudo-policy:
    it's a reasonable policy which suffers from a confusing implementation
    in terms of MPOL_PREFERRED with MPOL_F_LOCAL.  I believe this would be
    much more robust if MPOL_LOCAL were recognized in switch statements
    throughout, MPOL_F_LOCAL deleted, and MPOL_PREFERRED use the (possibly
    empty) nodes mask like everyone else, instead of its preferred_node
    variant (I presume an optimization from the days before MPOL_LOCAL).
    But that would take me too long to get right and fully tested.

    Implement the RFC 5691 mitigation against Blind
    Reset attack using SYN bit.
    
    Section 4.2 of RFC 5961 advises to send a Challenge ACK and drop
    incoming packet, instead of resetting the session.
    
    Add a new SNMP counter to count number of challenge acks sent
    in response to SYN packets.
    (netstat -s | grep TCPSYNChallenge)
    
    Remove obsolete TCPAbortOnSyn, since we no longer abort a TCP session
    because of a SYN flag.

    If sequence is in window but not an exact match, send
    a "challenge ACK", so that the other part can resend an
    RST with the appropriate sequence.
    
    Add a new sysctl, tcp_challenge_ack_limit, to limit
    number of challenge ACK sent per second.
    
    Add a new SNMP counter to count number of challenge acks sent.

    random: prime last_data value per fips requirements
    
    The value stored in last_data must be primed for FIPS 140-2 purposes. Upon
    first use, either on system startup or after an RNDCLEARPOOL ioctl, we
    need to take an initial random sample, store it internally in last_data,
    then pass along the value after that to the requester, so that consistency
    checks aren't being run against stale and possibly known data.

    mm: Fix PageHead when !CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED
    
    Unfortunately with !CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED, (!PageHead) is false, and
    (PageHead) is true, for tail pages.  If this is indeed the intended
    behavior, which I doubt because it breaks cache cleaning on some ARM
    systems, then the nomenclature is highly problematic.
    
    This patch makes sure PageHead is only true for head pages and PageTail
    is only true for tail pages, and neither is true for non-compound pages.
    
    [ This buglet seems ancient - seems to have been introduced back in Apr
      2008 in commit 6a1e7f777f61: "pageflags: convert to the use of new
      macros".  And the reason nobody noticed is because the PageHead()
      tests are almost all about just sanity-checking, and only used on
      pages that are actual page heads.  The fact that the old code returned
      true for tail pages too was thus not really noticeable.   - Linus ]

    tcp: should drop incoming frames without ACK flag set
    
    In commit 96e0bf4b5193d (tcp: Discard segments that ack data not yet
    sent) John Dykstra enforced a check against ack sequences.
    
    In commit 354e4aa391ed5 (tcp: RFC 5961 5.2 Blind Data Injection Attack
    Mitigation) I added more safety tests.
    
    But we missed fact that these tests are not performed if ACK bit is
    not set.
    
    RFC 793 3.9 mandates TCP should drop a frame without ACK flag set.
    
    " fifth check the ACK field,
          if the ACK bit is off drop the segment and return"
    
    Not doing so permits an attacker to only guess an acceptable sequence
    number, evading stronger checks.
    
    Many thanks to Zhiyun Qian for bringing this issue to our attention.

    RFC 5961 5.2 [Blind Data Injection Attack].[Mitigation]
    
      All TCP stacks MAY implement the following mitigation.  TCP stacks
      that implement this mitigation MUST add an additional input check to
      any incoming segment.  The ACK value is considered acceptable only if
      it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <=
      SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the
      above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.
    
    Move tcp_send_challenge_ack() before tcp_ack() to avoid a forward
    declaration.

commit abd28eb0c0348df8d14a951adc5b9dc367e00549
Author: Mel Gorman <mgorman@suse.de>

    Upstream commit: 18a2f371f5edf41810f6469cb9be39931ef9deb9
    
    tmpfs: fix shared mempolicy leak
    
    This fixes a regression in 3.7-rc, which has since gone into stable.
    
    Commit 00442ad04a5e ("mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount
    imbalance in alloc_pages_vma()") changed get_vma_policy() to raise the
    refcount on a shmem shared mempolicy; whereas shmem_alloc_page() went
    on expecting alloc_page_vma() to drop the refcount it had acquired.
    This deserves a rework: but for now fix the leak in shmem_alloc_page().
    
    Hugh: shmem_swapin() did not need a fix, but surely it's clearer to use
    the same refcounting there as in shmem_alloc_page(), delete its onstack
    mempolicy, and the strange mpol_cond_copy() and __mpol_cond_copy() -
    those were invented to let swapin_readahead() make an unknown number of
    calls to alloc_pages_vma() with one mempolicy; but since 00442ad04a5e,
    alloc_pages_vma() has kept refcount in balance, so now no problem.

    x86, kvm: Remove incorrect redundant assembly constraint
    
    In __emulate_1op_rax_rdx, we use "+a" and "+d" which are input/output
    constraints, and *then* use "a" and "d" as input constraints.  This is
    incorrect, but happens to work on some versions of gcc.
    
    However, it breaks gcc with -O0 and icc, and may break on future
    versions of gcc.

    I enable CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL and CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP, when doing
    memory hotremove, there is a kernel BUG at arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c:20.
    
    It is caused by free_section_usemap()->virt_to_page(), virt_to_page() is
    only used for kernel direct mapping address, but sparse-vmemmap uses
    vmemmap address, so it is going wrong here.

    sctp: Error in calculation of RTTvar
    
    The calculation of RTTVAR involves the subtraction of two unsigned
    numbers which
    may causes rollover and results in very high values of RTTVAR when RTT > SRTT.
    With this patch it is possible to set RTOmin = 1 to get the minimum of RTO at
    4 times the clock granularity.

    sctp: fix memory leak in sctp_datamsg_from_user() when copy from user space fails
    
    Trinity (the syscall fuzzer) discovered a memory leak in SCTP,
    reproducible e.g. with the sendto() syscall by passing invalid
    user space pointer in the second argument:
    
     #include <string.h>
     #include <arpa/inet.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
    
     int main(void)
     {
             int fd;
             struct sockaddr_in sa;
    
             fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 132 /*IPPROTO_SCTP*/);
             if (fd < 0)
                     return 1;
    
             memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
             sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
             sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
             sa.sin_port = htons(11111);
    
             sendto(fd, NULL, 1, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&sa, sizeof(sa));
    
             return 0;
     }
    
    As far as I can tell, the leak has been around since ~2003.

    futex: avoid wake_futex() for a PI futex_q
    
    Dave Jones reported a bug with futex_lock_pi() that his trinity test
    exposed.  Sometime between queue_me() and taking the q.lock_ptr, the
    lock_ptr became NULL, resulting in a crash.
    
    While futex_wake() is careful to not call wake_futex() on futex_q's with
    a pi_state or an rt_waiter (which are either waiting for a
    futex_unlock_pi() or a PI futex_requeue()), futex_wake_op() and
    futex_requeue() do not perform the same test.
    
    Update futex_wake_op() and futex_requeue() to test for q.pi_state and
    q.rt_waiter and abort with -EINVAL if detected.  To ensure any future
    breakage is caught, add a WARN() to wake_futex() if the same condition
    is true.
    
    This fix has seen 3 hours of testing with "trinity -c futex" on an
    x86_64 VM with 4 CPUS.

    futex: Handle futex_pi OWNER_DIED take over correctly
    
    Siddhesh analyzed a failure in the take over of pi futexes in case the
    owner died and provided a workaround.
    See: http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14076
    
    The detailed problem analysis shows:
    
    Futex F is initialized with PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT and
    PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_NP attributes.
    
    T1 lock_futex_pi(F);
    
    T2 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> T2 blocks on the futex and creates pi_state which is associated
           to T1.
    
    T1 exits
       --> exit_robust_list() runs
           --> Futex F userspace value TID field is set to 0 and
               FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set.
    
    T3 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> Succeeds due to the check for F's userspace TID field == 0
       --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the
           userspace TID field of futex F
       --> returns to user space
    
    T1 --> exit_pi_state_list()
           --> Transfers pi_state to waiter T2 and wakes T2 via
           	   rt_mutex_unlock(&pi_state->mutex)
    
    T2 --> acquires pi_state->mutex and gains real ownership of the
           pi_state
       --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the
           userspace TID field of futex F
       --> returns to user space
    
    T3 --> observes inconsistent state
    
    This problem is independent of UP/SMP, preemptible/non preemptible
    kernels, or process shared vs. private. The only difference is that
    certain configurations are more likely to expose it.
    
    So as Siddhesh correctly analyzed the following check in
    futex_lock_pi_atomic() is the culprit:
    
    	if (unlikely(ownerdied || !(curval & FUTEX_TID_MASK))) {
    
    We check the userspace value for a TID value of 0 and take over the
    futex unconditionally if that's true.
    
    AFAICT this check is there as it is correct for a different corner
    case of futexes: the WAITERS bit became stale.
    
    Now the proposed change
    
    -	if (unlikely(ownerdied || !(curval & FUTEX_TID_MASK))) {
    +       if (unlikely(ownerdied ||
    +                       !(curval & (FUTEX_TID_MASK | FUTEX_WAITERS)))) {
    
    solves the problem, but it's not obvious why and it wreckages the
    "stale WAITERS bit" case.
    
    What happens is, that due to the WAITERS bit being set (T2 is blocked
    on that futex) it enforces T3 to go through lookup_pi_state(), which
    in the above case returns an existing pi_state and therefor forces T3
    to legitimately fight with T2 over the ownership of the pi_state (via
    pi_state->mutex). Probelm solved!
    
    Though that does not work for the "WAITERS bit is stale" problem
    because if lookup_pi_state() does not find existing pi_state it
    returns -ERSCH (due to TID == 0) which causes futex_lock_pi() to
    return -ESRCH to user space because the OWNER_DIED bit is not set.
    
    Now there is a different solution to that problem. Do not look at the
    user space value at all and enforce a lookup of possibly available
    pi_state. If pi_state can be found, then the new incoming locker T3
    blocks on that pi_state and legitimately races with T2 to acquire the
    rt_mutex and the pi_state and therefor the proper ownership of the
    user space futex.
    
    lookup_pi_state() has the correct order of checks. It first tries to
    find a pi_state associated with the user space futex and only if that
    fails it checks for futex TID value = 0. If no pi_state is available
    nothing can create new state at that point because this happens with
    the hash bucket lock held.
    
    So the above scenario changes to:
    
    T1 lock_futex_pi(F);
    
    T2 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> T2 blocks on the futex and creates pi_state which is associated
           to T1.
    
    T1 exits
       --> exit_robust_list() runs
           --> Futex F userspace value TID field is set to 0 and
               FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit is set.
    
    T3 lock_futex_pi(F);
       --> Finds pi_state and blocks on pi_state->rt_mutex
    
    T1 --> exit_pi_state_list()
           --> Transfers pi_state to waiter T2 and wakes it via
           	   rt_mutex_unlock(&pi_state->mutex)
    
    T2 --> acquires pi_state->mutex and gains ownership of the pi_state
       --> Claims ownership of the futex and sets its own TID into the
           userspace TID field of futex F
       --> returns to user space
    
    This covers all gazillion points on which T3 might come in between
    T1's exit_robust_list() clearing the TID field and T2 fixing it up. It
    also solves the "WAITERS bit stale" problem by forcing the take over.
    
    Another benefit of changing the code this way is that it makes it less
    dependent on untrusted user space values and therefor minimizes the
    possible wreckage which might be inflicted.
    
    As usual after staring for too long at the futex code my brain hurts
    so much that I really want to ditch that whole optimization of
    avoiding the syscall for the non contended case for PI futexes and rip
    out the maze of corner case handling code. Unfortunately we can't as
    user space relies on that existing behaviour, but at least thinking
    about it helps me to preserve my mental sanity. Maybe we should
    nevertheless :)

    mm/hotplug: correctly add new zone to all other nodes' zone lists
    
    When online_pages() is called to add new memory to an empty zone, it
    rebuilds all zone lists by calling build_all_zonelists().  But there's a
    bug which prevents the new zone to be added to other nodes' zone lists.
    
    online_pages() {
    	build_all_zonelists()
    	.....
    	node_set_state(zone_to_nid(zone), N_HIGH_MEMORY)
    }
    
    Here the node of the zone is put into N_HIGH_MEMORY state after calling
    build_all_zonelists(), but build_all_zonelists() only adds zones from
    nodes in N_HIGH_MEMORY state to the fallback zone lists.
    build_all_zonelists()
    
        ->__build_all_zonelists()
    	->build_zonelists()
    	    ->find_next_best_node()
    		->for_each_node_state(n, N_HIGH_MEMORY)
    
    So memory in the new zone will never be used by other nodes, and it may
    cause strange behavor when system is under memory pressure.  So put node
    into N_HIGH_MEMORY state before calling build_all_zonelists().

    Fix an issue with nested subjects reported by Mark Moseley
    
    If a nested subject exists for which there are more than one objects
    that can match it (a directory nested subject can make this possible)
    then since the recent patch that fixed policy recreation for nested
    subjects, a cycle can be introduced in the nested subject list for a role,
    causing infinite loops under a lock on policy recreation events or
    RBAC disabling/reloading.
    
    Only add the nested subject to the list if it was the first time we've
    seen it, to eliminate duplicates and inadvertent cycles.

    net: fix divide by zero in tcp algorithm illinois
    
    Reading TCP stats when using TCP Illinois congestion control algorithm
    can cause a divide by zero kernel oops.
    
    The division by zero occur in tcp_illinois_info() at:
     do_div(t, ca->cnt_rtt);
    where ca->cnt_rtt can become zero (when rtt_reset is called)
    
    Steps to Reproduce:
     1. Register tcp_illinois:
         # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=illinois
     2. Monitor internal TCP information via command "ss -i"
         # watch -d ss -i
     3. Establish new TCP conn to machine
    
    Either it fails at the initial conn, or else it needs to wait
    for a loss or a reset.
    
    This is only related to reading stats.  The function avg_delay() also
    performs the same divide, but is guarded with a (ca->cnt_rtt > 0) at its
    calling point in update_params().  Thus, simply fix tcp_illinois_info().
    
    Function tcp_illinois_info() / get_info() is called without
    socket lock.  Thus, eliminate any race condition on ca->cnt_rtt
    by using a local stack variable.  Simply reuse info.tcpv_rttcnt,
    as its already set to ca->cnt_rtt.
    Function avg_delay() is not affected by this race condition, as
    its called with the socket lock.

    A number of places in the mesh code don't check that

    pskb_may_pull() calls. This prevents accessing data
    that doesn't actually exist.
    
    To do this, export ieee80211_get_mesh_hdrlen() to be
    able to use it in mac80211.

    l2tp: fix oops in l2tp_eth_create() error path
    
    When creating an L2TPv3 Ethernet session, if register_netdev() should fail for
    any reason (for example, automatic naming for "l2tpeth%d" interfaces hits the
    32k-interface limit), the netdev is freed in the error path.  However, the
    l2tp_eth_sess structure's dev pointer is left uncleared, and this results in
    l2tp_eth_delete() then attempting to unregister the same netdev later in the
    session teardown.  This results in an oops.
    
    To avoid this, clear the session dev pointer in the error path.

    target: Avoid integer overflow in se_dev_align_max_sectors()
    
    The expression (max_sectors * block_size) might overflow a u32
    (indeed, since iblock sets max_hw_sectors to UINT_MAX, it is
    guaranteed to overflow and end up with a much-too-small result in many
    common cases).  Fix this by doing an equivalent calculation that
    doesn't require multiplication.
    
    While we're touching this code, avoid splitting a printk format across
    two lines and use pr_info(...) instead of printk(KERN_INFO ...).

    Don't treat pivot_root as a chroot, fixes some issues with RHEL6 initrd
    causing tty1 console problems due to denied capability usage.  Both the
    chroot capability restrictions and separate chroot feature prevent pivot_root

    vfs: dcache: fix deadlock in tree traversal
    
    IBM reported a deadlock in select_parent().  This was found to be caused
    by taking rename_lock when already locked when restarting the tree
    traversal.
    
    There are two cases when the traversal needs to be restarted:
    
     1) concurrent d_move(); this can only happen when not already locked,
        since taking rename_lock protects against concurrent d_move().
    
     2) racing with final d_put() on child just at the moment of ascending
        to parent; rename_lock doesn't protect against this rare race, so it
        can happen when already locked.
    
    Because of case 2, we need to be able to handle restarting the traversal
    when rename_lock is already held.  This patch fixes all three callers of
    try_to_ascend().
    
    IBM reported that the deadlock is gone with this patch.
    
    [ I rewrote the patch to be smaller and just do the "goto again" if the
      lock was already held, but credit goes to Miklos for the real work.

    mtdchar: fix offset overflow detection
    
    Sasha Levin has been running trinity in a KVM tools guest, and was able
    to trigger the BUG_ON() at arch/x86/mm/pat.c:279 (verifying the range of
    the memory type).  The call trace showed that it was mtdchar_mmap() that
    created an invalid remap_pfn_range().
    
    The problem is that mtdchar_mmap() does various really odd and subtle
    things with the vma page offset etc, and uses the wrong types (and the
    wrong overflow) detection for it.
    
    For example, the page offset may well be 32-bit on a 32-bit
    architecture, but after shifting it up by PAGE_SHIFT, we need to use a
    potentially 64-bit resource_size_t to correctly hold the full value.
    
    Also, we need to check that the vma length plus offset doesn't overflow
    before we check that it is smaller than the length of the mtdmap region.
    
    This fixes things up and tries to make the code a bit easier to read.

    xen/boot: Disable NUMA for PV guests.
    
    The hypervisor is in charge of allocating the proper "NUMA" memory
    and dealing with the CPU scheduler to keep them bound to the proper
    NUMA node. The PV guests (and PVHVM) have no inkling of where they
    run and do not need to know that right now. In the future we will
    need to inject NUMA configuration data (if a guest spans two or more
    NUMA nodes) so that the kernel can make the right choices. But those
    patches are not yet present.
    
    In the meantime, disable the NUMA capability in the PV guest, which
    also fixes a bootup issue. Andre says:
    
    "we see Dom0 crashes due to the kernel detecting the NUMA topology not
    by ACPI, but directly from the northbridge (CONFIG_AMD_NUMA).
    
    This will detect the actual NUMA config of the physical machine, but
    will crash about the mismatch with Dom0's virtual memory. Variation of
    the theme: Dom0 sees what it's not supposed to see.
    
    This happens with the said config option enabled and on a machine where
    this scanning is still enabled (K8 and Fam10h, not Bulldozer class)
    
    We have this dump then:
    NUMA: Warning: node ids are out of bound, from=-1 to=-1 distance=10

    contains as many bytes as the header indicates. If a user creates a new
    state or updates an existing one but does not supply the bytes for the
    whole ESN replay window, the kernel copies random heap bytes into the
    replay bitmap, the ones happen to follow the XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL
    netlink attribute. This leads to following issues:
    
    1. The replay window has random bits set confusing the replay handling
       code later on.
    
    2. A malicious user could use this flaw to leak up to ~3.5kB of heap
       memory when she has access to the XFRM netlink interface (requires
       CAP_NET_ADMIN).
    
    Known users of the ESN replay window are strongSwan and Steffen's
    iproute2 patch (<http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/85962/>). The latter
    uses the interface with a bitmap supplied while the former does not.
    strongSwan is therefore prone to run into issue 1.
    
    To fix both issues without breaking existing userland allow using the
    XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL netlink attribute with either an empty bitmap or a
    fully specified one. For the former case we initialize the in-kernel
    bitmap with zero, for the latter we copy the user supplied bitmap. For
    state updates the full bitmap must be supplied.
    
    To prevent overflows in the bitmap length calculation the maximum size
    of bmp_len is limited to 128 by this patch -- resulting in a maximum
    replay window of 4096 packets. This should be sufficient for all real
    life scenarios (RFC 4303 recommends a default replay window size of 64).

    v3:
    - revert size_t change to xfrm_replay_state_esn_len() (requested by Steffen)
    - switch to int types for lengths (suggested by Ben)
    - implement 4096 packets limit for bmp_len to avoid overflows in
      xfrm_replay_state_esn_len()
    v2:
    - compare against klen in xfrm_alloc_replay_state_esn (suggested by Ben)
    - make xfrm_replay_state_esn_len() return size_t

    vfs: dcache: use DCACHE_DENTRY_KILLED instead of DCACHE_DISCONNECTED in d_kill()
    
    IBM reported a soft lockup after applying the fix for the rename_lock
    deadlock.  Commit c83ce989cb5f ("VFS: Fix the nfs sillyrename regression
    in kernel 2.6.38") was found to be the culprit.
    
    The nfs sillyrename fix used DCACHE_DISCONNECTED to indicate that the
    dentry was killed.  This flag can be set on non-killed dentries too,
    which results in infinite retries when trying to traverse the dentry
    tree.
    
    This patch introduces a separate flag: DCACHE_DENTRY_KILLED, which is
    only set in d_kill() and makes try_to_ascend() test only this flag.
    
    IBM reported successful test results with this patch.

    perf_event: Switch to internal refcount, fix race with close()
    
    Don't mess with file refcounts (or keep a reference to file, for
    that matter) in perf_event.  Use explicit refcount of its own
    instead.  Deal with the race between the final reference to event
    going away and new children getting created for it by use of
    atomic_long_inc_not_zero() in inherit_event(); just have the
    latter free what it had allocated and return NULL, that works
    out just fine (children of siblings of something doomed are
    created as singletons, same as if the child of leader had been
    created and immediately killed).

    Upstream commit: 8335eafc2859e1a26282bef7c3d19f3d68868b8a
    
    eCryptfs: Copy up attributes of the lower target inode after rename
    
    After calling into the lower filesystem to do a rename, the lower target
    inode's attributes were not copied up to the eCryptfs target inode. This
    resulted in the eCryptfs target inode staying around, rather than being
    evicted, because i_nlink was not updated for the eCryptfs inode. This
    also meant that eCryptfs didn't do the final iput() on the lower target
    inode so it stayed around, as well. This would result in a failure to
    free up space occupied by the target file in the rename() operation.
    Both target inodes would eventually be evicted when the eCryptfs
    filesystem was unmounted.
    
    This patch calls fsstack_copy_attr_all() after the lower filesystem
    does its ->rename() so that important inode attributes, such as i_nlink,
    are updated at the eCryptfs layer. ecryptfs_evict_inode() is now called
    and eCryptfs can drop its final reference on the lower inode.

    This is a completely different CONFIG_HOTPLUG problem, only
    demonstrating another reason why CONFIG_HOTPLUG should go away.  I had a
    hard time trying to disable it anyway ;-)
    
    The problem this time is lots of code assuming that a call to
    add_uevent_var() will guarantee that env->buflen > 0.  This is not true
    if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is unset.  So things like this end up overwriting
    env->envp_idx because the array index is -1:
    
    	if (add_uevent_var(env, "MODALIAS="))
    		return -ENOMEM;
            len = input_print_modalias(&env->buf[env->buflen - 1],
    				   sizeof(env->buf) - env->buflen,
    				   dev, 0);
    
    Don't know what the best action is, given that there seem to be a *lot*
    of this around the kernel.  This patch "fixes" the problem for me, but I
    don't know if it can be considered an appropriate fix.
    
    [ It is the correct fix for now, for 3.7 forcing CONFIG_HOTPLUG to
    always be on is the longterm fix, but it's too late for 3.6 and older

    Subject: [PATCH] xfrm_user: return error pointer instead of NULL
    Date: Thu, 13 Sep 2012 23:41:26 +0200
    
    When dump_one_state() returns an error, e.g. because of a too small
    buffer to dump the whole xfrm state, xfrm_state_netlink() returns NULL
    instead of an error pointer. But its callers expect an error pointer
    and therefore continue to operate on a NULL skbuff.
    
    This could lead to a privilege escalation (execution of user code in
    kernel context) if the attacker has CAP_NET_ADMIN and is able to map
    address 0.

    netlink: fix possible spoofing from non-root processes
    
    Non-root user-space processes can send Netlink messages to other
    processes that are well-known for being subscribed to Netlink
    asynchronous notifications. This allows ilegitimate non-root
    process to send forged messages to Netlink subscribers.
    
    The userspace process usually verifies the legitimate origin in
    two ways:
    
    a) Socket credentials. If UID != 0, then the message comes from
       some ilegitimate process and the message needs to be dropped.
    
    b) Netlink portID. In general, portID == 0 means that the origin
       of the messages comes from the kernel. Thus, discarding any
       message not coming from the kernel.
    
    However, ctnetlink sets the portID in event messages that has
    been triggered by some user-space process, eg. conntrack utility.
    So other processes subscribed to ctnetlink events, eg. conntrackd,
    know that the event was triggered by some user-space action.
    
    Neither of the two ways to discard ilegitimate messages coming
    from non-root processes can help for ctnetlink.
    
    This patch adds capability validation in case that dst_pid is set
    in netlink_sendmsg(). This approach is aggressive since existing
    applications using any Netlink bus to deliver messages between
    two user-space processes will break. Note that the exception is
    NETLINK_USERSOCK, since it is reserved for netlink-to-netlink
    userspace communication.
    
    Still, if anyone wants that his Netlink bus allows netlink-to-netlink
    userspace, then they can set NL_NONROOT_SEND. However, by default,
    I don't think it makes sense to allow to use NETLINK_ROUTE to
    communicate two processes that are sending no matter what information
    that is not related to link/neighbouring/routing. They should be using
    NETLINK_USERSOCK instead for that.

    llc: fix info leak via getsockname()
    
    The LLC code wrongly returns 0, i.e. "success", when the socket is
    zapped. Together with the uninitialized uaddrlen pointer argument from
    sys_getsockname this leads to an arbitrary memory leak of up to 128
    bytes kernel stack via the getsockname() syscall.
    
    Return an error instead when the socket is zapped to prevent the info
    leak. Also remove the unnecessary memset(0). We don't directly write to
    the memory pointed by uaddr but memcpy() a local structure at the end of
    the function that is properly initialized.

    af_netlink: force credentials passing [CVE-2012-3520]
    
    Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered that avahi and
    potentially NetworkManager accept spoofed Netlink messages because of a
    kernel bug.  The kernel passes all-zero SCM_CREDENTIALS ancillary data
    to the receiver if the sender did not provide such data, instead of not
    including any such data at all or including the correct data from the
    peer (as it is the case with AF_UNIX).
    
    This bug was introduced in commit 16e572626961
    (af_unix: dont send SCM_CREDENTIALS by default)
    
    This patch forces passing credentials for netlink, as
    before the regression.
    
    Another fix would be to not add SCM_CREDENTIALS in
    netlink messages if not provided by the sender, but it
    might break some programs.
    
    With help from Florian Weimer & Petr Matousek
    
    This issue is designated as CVE-2012-3520

    futex: Forbid uaddr == uaddr2 in futex_wait_requeue_pi()
    
    If uaddr == uaddr2, then we have broken the rule of only requeueing
    from a non-pi futex to a pi futex with this call. If we attempt this,
    as the trinity test suite manages to do, we miss early wakeups as
    q.key is equal to key2 (because they are the same uaddr). We will then
    attempt to dereference the pi_mutex (which would exist had the futex_q
    been properly requeued to a pi futex) and trigger a NULL pointer
    dereference.

    fs: make dumpable=2 require fully qualified path
    
    When the suid_dumpable sysctl is set to "2", and there is no core dump
    pipe defined in the core_pattern sysctl, a local user can cause core files
    to be written to root-writable directories, potentially with
    user-controlled content.
    
    This means an admin can unknowningly reintroduce a variation of
    CVE-2006-2451, allowing local users to gain root privileges.
    
      $ cat /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
      2
      $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
      core
      $ ulimit -c unlimited
      $ cd /
      $ ls -l core
      ls: cannot access core: No such file or directory
      $ touch core
      touch: cannot touch `core': Permission denied
      $ OHAI="evil-string-here" ping localhost >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      $ pid=$!
      $ sleep 1
      $ kill -SEGV $pid
      $ ls -l core
      -rw------- 1 root kees 458752 Jun 21 11:35 core
      $ sudo strings core | grep evil
      OHAI=evil-string-here
    
    While cron has been fixed to abort reading a file when there is any
    parse error, there are still other sensitive directories that will read
    any file present and skip unparsable lines.
    
    Instead of introducing a suid_dumpable=3 mode and breaking all users of
    mode 2, this only disables the unsafe portion of mode 2 (writing to disk
    via relative path).  Most users of mode 2 (e.g.  Chrome OS) already use
    a core dump pipe handler, so this change will not break them.  For the
    situations where a pipe handler is not defined but mode 2 is still
    active, crash dumps will only be written to fully qualified paths.  If a
    relative path is defined (e.g.  the default "core" pattern), dump
    attempts will trigger a printk yelling about the lack of a fully
    qualified path.

    panic: fix a possible deadlock in panic()
    
    panic_lock is meant to ensure that panic processing takes place only on
    one cpu; if any of the other cpus encounter a panic, they will spin
    waiting to be shut down.
    
    However, this causes a regression in this scenario:
    
    1. Cpu 0 encounters a panic and acquires the panic_lock
       and proceeds with the panic processing.
    2. There is an interrupt on cpu 0 that also encounters
       an error condition and invokes panic.
    3. This second invocation fails to acquire the panic_lock
       and enters the infinite while loop in panic_smp_self_stop.
    
    Thus all panic processing is stopped, and the cpu is stuck for eternity
    in the while(1) inside panic_smp_self_stop.
    
    To address this, disable local interrupts with local_irq_disable before
    acquiring the panic_lock.  This will prevent interrupt handlers from
    executing during the panic processing, thus avoiding this particular
    problem.

    lib/vsprintf.c: kptr_restrict: fix pK-error in SysRq show-all-timers(Q)
    
    When using ALT+SysRq+Q all the pointers are replaced with "pK-error" like
    this:
    
    	[23153.208033]   .base:               pK-error
    
    with echo h > /proc/sysrq-trigger it works:
    
    	[23107.776363]   .base:       ffff88023e60d540
    
    The intent behind this behavior was to return "pK-error" in cases where
    the %pK format specifier was used in interrupt context, because the
    CAP_SYSLOG check wouldn't be meaningful.  Clearly this should only apply
    when kptr_restrict is actually enabled though.

    rds: set correct msg_namelen
    
    Jay Fenlason (fenlason@redhat.com) found a bug,
    that recvfrom() on an RDS socket can return the contents of random kernel
    memory to userspace if it was called with a address length larger than
    sizeof(struct sockaddr_in).
    rds_recvmsg() also fails to set the addr_len paramater properly before
    returning, but that's just a bug.
    There are also a number of cases wher recvfrom() can return an entirely bogus
    address. Anything in rds_recvmsg() that returns a non-negative value but does
    not go through the "sin = (struct sockaddr_in *)msg->msg_name;" code path
    at the end of the while(1) loop will return up to 128 bytes of kernel memory
    to userspace.
    
    And I write two test programs to reproduce this bug, you will see that in
    rds_server, fromAddr will be overwritten and the following sock_fd will be
    destroyed.
    Yes, it is the programmer's fault to set msg_namelen incorrectly, but it is
    better to make the kernel copy the real length of address to user space in
    such case.
    
    How to run the test programs ?
    I test them on 32bit x86 system, 3.5.0-rc7.
    
    1 compile
    gcc -o rds_client rds_client.c
    gcc -o rds_server rds_server.c
    
    2 run ./rds_server on one console
    
    3 run ./rds_client on another console
    
    4 you will see something like:
    server is waiting to receive data...
    old socket fd=3
    server received data from client:data from client
    msg.msg_namelen=32
    new socket fd=-1067277685

    locks: fix checking of fcntl_setlease argument
    
    The only checks of the long argument passed to fcntl(fd,F_SETLEASE,.)
    are done after converting the long to an int.  Thus some illegal values
    may be let through and cause problems in later code.
    
    [ They actually *don't* cause problems in mainline, as of Dave Jones's
      commit 8d657eb3b438 "Remove easily user-triggerable BUG from
      generic_setlease", but we should fix this anyway.  And this patch will
      be necessary to fix real bugs on earlier kernels. ]

    fifo: Do not restart open() if it already found a partner
    
    If a parent and child process open the two ends of a fifo, and the
    child immediately exits, the parent may receive a SIGCHLD before its
    open() returns.  In that case, we need to make sure that open() will
    return successfully after the SIGCHLD handler returns, instead of
    throwing EINTR or being restarted.  Otherwise, the restarted open()
    would incorrectly wait for a second partner on the other end.
    
    The following test demonstrates the EINTR that was wrongly thrown from
    the parent’s open().  Change .sa_flags = 0 to .sa_flags = SA_RESTART
    to see a deadlock instead, in which the restarted open() waits for a
    second reader that will never come.  (On my systems, this happens
    pretty reliably within about 5 to 500 iterations.  Others report that
    it manages to loop ~forever sometimes; YMMV.)

    ipvs: fix oops on NAT reply in br_nf context
    
    IPVS should not reset skb->nf_bridge in FORWARD hook
    by calling nf_reset for NAT replies. It triggers oops in
    br_nf_forward_finish.

    The steps to reproduce as follow,
    
    1. On Host1, setup brige br0(192.168.1.106)
    2. Boot a kvm guest(192.168.1.105) on Host1 and start httpd
    3. Start IPVS service on Host1
       ipvsadm -A -t 192.168.1.106:80 -s rr
       ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.1.106:80 -r 192.168.1.105:80 -m
    4. Run apache benchmark on Host2(192.168.1.101)
       ab -n 1000 http://192.168.1.106/
    
    ip_vs_reply4
      ip_vs_out
        handle_response
          ip_vs_notrack
            nf_reset()
            {
              skb->nf_bridge = NULL;
            }
    
    Actually, IPVS wants in this case just to replace nfct
    with untracked version. So replace the nf_reset(skb) call
    in ip_vs_notrack() with a nf_conntrack_put(skb->nfct) call.

    tcm_fc: Fix crash seen with aborts and large reads
    
    This patch fixes a crash seen when large reads have their exchange
    aborted by either timing out or being reset. Because the exchange
    abort results in the seq pointer being set to NULL, because the
    sequence is no longer valid, it must not be dereferenced. This
    patch changes the function ft_get_task_tag to return ~0 if it is
    unable to get the tag for this reason. Because the get_task_tag
    interface provides no means of returning an error, this seems
    like the best way to fix this issue at the moment.

    target: Fix range calculation in WRITE SAME emulation when num blocks == 0
    
    When NUMBER OF LOGICAL BLOCKS is 0, WRITE SAME is supposed to write
    all the blocks from the specified LBA through the end of the device.
    However, dev->transport->get_blocks(dev) (perhaps confusingly) returns
    the last valid LBA rather than the number of blocks, so the correct
    number of blocks to write starting with lba is
    
    dev->transport->get_blocks(dev) - lba + 1

    ixgbevf: Prevent RX/TX statistics getting reset to zero
    
    The commit 4197aa7bb81877ebb06e4f2cc1b5fea2da23a7bd implements 64 bit
    per ring statistics. But the driver resets the 'total_bytes' and
    'total_packets' from RX and TX rings in the RX and TX interrupt
    handlers to zero. This results in statistics being lost and user space
    reporting RX and TX statistics as zero. This patch addresses the
    issue by preventing the resetting of RX and TX ring statistics to
    zero.

    It appears from his analysis and some staring at the code that this is likely
    occuring because an association is getting freed while still on the
    sctp_assoc_hashtable.  As a result, we get a gpf when traversing the hashtable
    while a freed node corrupts part of the list.
    
    Nominally I would think that an mibalanced refcount was responsible for this,
    but I can't seem to find any obvious imbalance.  What I did note however was
    that the two places where we create an association using
    sctp_primitive_ASSOCIATE (__sctp_connect and sctp_sendmsg), have failure paths
    which free a newly created association after calling sctp_primitive_ASSOCIATE.
    sctp_primitive_ASSOCIATE brings us into the sctp_sf_do_prm_asoc path, which
    issues a SCTP_CMD_NEW_ASOC side effect, which in turn adds a new association to
    the aforementioned hash table.  the sctp command interpreter that process side
    effects has not way to unwind previously processed commands, so freeing the
    association from the __sctp_connect or sctp_sendmsg error path would lead to a
    freed association remaining on this hash table.
    
    I've fixed this but modifying sctp_[un]hash_established to use hlist_del_init,
    which allows us to proerly use hlist_unhashed to check if the node is on a
    hashlist safely during a delete.  That in turn alows us to safely call
    sctp_unhash_established in the __sctp_connect and sctp_sendmsg error paths
    before freeing them, regardles of what the associations state is on the hash
    list.
    
    I noted, while I was doing this, that the __sctp_unhash_endpoint was using
    hlist_unhsashed in a simmilar fashion, but never nullified any removed nodes
    pointers to make that function work properly, so I fixed that up in a simmilar
    fashion.
    
    I attempted to test this using a virtual guest running the SCTP_RR test from
    netperf in a loop while running the trinity fuzzer, both in a loop.  I wasn't
    able to recreate the problem prior to this fix, nor was I able to trigger the
    failure after (neither of which I suppose is suprising).  Given the trace above
    however, I think its likely that this is what we hit.

    mm: fix lost kswapd wakeup in kswapd_stop()
    
    Offlining memory may block forever, waiting for kswapd() to wake up
    because kswapd() does not check the event kthread->should_stop before
    sleeping.
    
    The proper pattern, from Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, is:
    
       ---  waker  ---
       event_indicated = 1;
       wake_up_process(event_daemon);
    
       ---  sleeper  ---
       for (;;) {
          set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
          if (event_indicated)
             break;
          schedule();
       }
    
       set_current_state() may be wrapped by:
          prepare_to_wait();
    
    In the kswapd() case, event_indicated is kthread->should_stop.
    
      === offlining memory (waker) ===
       kswapd_stop()
          kthread_stop()
             kthread->should_stop = 1
             wake_up_process()
             wait_for_completion()
    
      ===  kswapd_try_to_sleep (sleeper) ===
       kswapd_try_to_sleep()
          prepare_to_wait()
               .
               .
          schedule()
               .
               .
          finish_wait()
    
    The schedule() needs to be protected by a test of kthread->should_stop,
    which is wrapped by kthread_should_stop().
    
    Reproducer:
       Do heavy file I/O in background.
       Do a memory offline/online in a tight loop

    cx25821: Remove bad strcpy to read-only char*
    
    The strcpy was being used to set the name of the board.  Since the
    destination char* was read-only and the name is set statically at
    compile time; this was both wrong and redundant.
    
    The type of char* is changed to const char* to prevent future errors.

    md: avoid crash when stopping md array races with closing other open fds.
    
    md will refuse to stop an array if any other fd (or mounted fs) is
    using it.
    When any fs is unmounted of when the last open fd is closed all
    pending IO will be flushed (e.g. sync_blockdev call in __blkdev_put)
    so there will be no pending IO to worry about when the array is
    stopped.
    
    However in order to send the STOP_ARRAY ioctl to stop the array one
    must first get and open fd on the block device.
    If some fd is being used to write to the block device and it is closed
    after mdadm open the block device, but before mdadm issues the
    STOP_ARRAY ioctl, then there will be no last-close on the md device so
    __blkdev_put will not call sync_blockdev.
    
    If this happens, then IO can still be in-flight while md tears down
    the array and bad things can happen (use-after-free and subsequent
    havoc).
    
    So in the case where do_md_stop is being called from an open file
    descriptor, call sync_block after taking the mutex to ensure there
    will be no new openers.
    
    This is needed when setting a read-write device to read-only too.

    cipso: don't follow a NULL pointer when setsockopt() is called
    
    As reported by Alan Cox, and verified by Lin Ming, when a user
    attempts to add a CIPSO option to a socket using the CIPSO_V4_TAG_LOCAL
    tag the kernel dies a terrible death when it attempts to follow a NULL
    pointer (the skb argument to cipso_v4_validate() is NULL when called via
    the setsockopt() syscall).
    
    This patch fixes this by first checking to ensure that the skb is
    non-NULL before using it to find the incoming network interface.  In
    the unlikely case where the skb is NULL and the user attempts to add
    a CIPSO option with the _TAG_LOCAL tag we return an error as this is
    not something we want to allow.
    
    A simple reproducer, kindly supplied by Lin Ming, although you must
    have the CIPSO DOI #3 configure on the system first or you will be
    caught early in cipso_v4_validate():
    
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <sys/socket.h>
    	#include <linux/ip.h>

    	struct local_tag {
    		char type;
    		char length;
    		char info[4];
    	};
    
    	struct cipso {
    		char type;
    		char length;
    		char doi[4];
    		struct local_tag local;
    	};
    
    	int main(int argc, char **argv)
    	{
    		int sockfd;
    		struct cipso cipso = {
    			.type = IPOPT_CIPSO,
    			.length = sizeof(struct cipso),
    			.local = {
    				.type = 128,
    				.length = sizeof(struct local_tag),
    			},
    		};
    
    		memset(cipso.doi, 0, 4);
    		cipso.doi[3] = 3;
    
    		sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

    block: fix infinite loop in __getblk_slow
    
    Commit 080399aaaf35 ("block: don't mark buffers beyond end of disk as
    mapped") exposed a bug in __getblk_slow that causes mount to hang as it
    loops infinitely waiting for a buffer that lies beyond the end of the
    disk to become uptodate.
    
    The problem was initially reported by Torsten Hilbrich here:
    
        https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/18/54
    
    and also reported independently here:
    
        http://www.sysresccd.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4511
    
    and then Richard W.M.  Jones and Marcos Mello noted a few separate
    bugzillas also associated with the same issue.  This patch has been
    confirmed to fix:
    
        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=835019
    
    The main problem is here, in __getblk_slow:
    
            for (;;) {
                    struct buffer_head * bh;
                    int ret;
    
                    bh = __find_get_block(bdev, block, size);
                    if (bh)
                            return bh;
    
                    ret = grow_buffers(bdev, block, size);
                    if (ret < 0)
                            return NULL;
                    if (ret == 0)
                            free_more_memory();
            }
    
    __find_get_block does not find the block, since it will not be marked as
    mapped, and so grow_buffers is called to fill in the buffers for the
    associated page.  I believe the for (;;) loop is there primarily to
    retry in the case of memory pressure keeping grow_buffers from
    succeeding.  However, we also continue to loop for other cases, like the
    block lying beond the end of the disk.  So, the fix I came up with is to
    only loop when grow_buffers fails due to memory allocation issues
    (return value of 0).
    
    The attached patch was tested by myself, Torsten, and Rich, and was
    found to resolve the problem in call cases.

    memory hotplug: fix invalid memory access caused by stale kswapd pointer
    
    kswapd_stop() is called to destroy the kswapd work thread when all memory
    of a NUMA node has been offlined.  But kswapd_stop() only terminates the
    work thread without resetting NODE_DATA(nid)->kswapd to NULL.  The stale
    pointer will prevent kswapd_run() from creating a new work thread when
    adding memory to the memory-less NUMA node again.  Eventually the stale
    pointer may cause invalid memory access.
    
    An example stack dump as below. It's reproduced with 2.6.32, but latest
    kernel has the same issue.

    ocfs2: fix NULL pointer dereference in __ocfs2_change_file_space()
    
    As ocfs2_fallocate() will invoke __ocfs2_change_file_space() with a NULL
    as the first parameter (file), it may trigger a NULL pointer dereferrence
    due to a missing check.

    sched: Fix fork() error path to not crash
    
    In dup_task_struct(), if arch_dup_task_struct() fails, the clean up
    code fails to clean up correctly.  That's because the clean up
    code depends on unininitalized ti->task pointer.  We fix this
    by making sure that the task and thread_info know about each other
    before we attempt to take the error path.

    Fix possible race on RBAC disable by ensuring all other
    CPUs are forced out of the kernel -- this is preferable to
    other locking methods that would impact performance of common paths
    for what should be a very infrequent operation that doesn't
    need to be fast

    epoll: clear the tfile_check_list on -ELOOP
    
    An epoll_ctl(,EPOLL_CTL_ADD,,) operation can return '-ELOOP' to prevent
    circular epoll dependencies from being created.  However, in that case we
    do not properly clear the 'tfile_check_list'.  Thus, add a call to
    clear_tfile_check_list() for the -ELOOP case.

    x86, amd, xen: Avoid NULL pointer paravirt references
    
    Stub out MSR methods that aren't actually needed.  This fixes a crash
    as Xen Dom0 on AMD Trinity systems.  A bigger patch should be added to
    remove the paravirt machinery completely for the methods which
    apparently have no users!

    In two places we don't enforce the hard limits for CAP_SYS_RESOURCE apps.
    In preparation for making more reasonable hard limits, start enforcing

    leds: Use kcalloc instead of kzalloc to allocate array

    mm: fix off-by-one bug in print_nodes_state()
    
    /sys/devices/system/node/{online,possible} outputs a garbage byte
    because print_nodes_state() returns content size + 1.  To fix the bug,
    the patch changes the use of cpuset_sprintf_cpulist to follow the use at
    other places, which is clearer and safer.
    
    This bug was introduced in v2.6.24 (commit bde631a51876: "mm: add node
    states sysfs class attributeS").

    mm: fix vma_resv_map() NULL pointer
    
    hugetlb_reserve_pages() can be used for either normal file-backed
    hugetlbfs mappings, or MAP_HUGETLB.  In the MAP_HUGETLB, semi-anonymous
    mode, there is not a VMA around.  The new call to resv_map_put() assumed
    that there was, and resulted in a NULL pointer dereference:

    This was reported by Dave Jones, but was reproducible with the
    libhugetlbfs test cases, so shame on me for not running them in the
    first place.
    
    With this, the oops is gone, and the output of libhugetlbfs's
    run_tests.py is identical to plain 3.4 again.
    
    [ Marked for stable, since this was introduced by commit c50ac050811d

    Subject: [RFC][PATCH] hugetlb: fix resv_map leak in error path
    
    When called for anonymous (non-shared) mappings,
    hugetlb_reserve_pages() does a resv_map_alloc().  It depends on
    code in hugetlbfs's vm_ops->close() to release that allocation.
    
    However, in the mmap() failure path, we do a plain unmap_region()
    without the remove_vma() which actually calls vm_ops->close().
    
    This is a decent fix.  This leak could get reintroduced if
    new code (say, after hugetlb_reserve_pages() in
    hugetlbfs_file_mmap()) decides to return an error.  But, I think
    it would have to unroll the reservation anyway.
    
    This hasn't been extensively tested.  Pretty much compile and
    boot tested along with Christoph's test case.
    
    Comments?

    [PATCH] mm: read_pmd_atomic: fix 32bit PAE pmd walk vs pmd_populate SMP race condition
    
    When holding the mmap_sem for reading, pmd_offset_map_lock should only
    run on a pmd_t that has been read atomically from the pmdp
    pointer, otherwise we may read only half of it leading to this crash.

    This should be a longstanding bug affecting x86 32bit PAE without
    THP. Only archs with 64bit large pmd_t and 32bit unsigned long should
    be affected.
    
    With THP enabled the barrier() in
    pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() would partly hide the bug when
    the pmd transition from none to stable, by forcing a re-read of the
    *pmd in pmd_offset_map_lock, but when THP is enabled a new set of
    problem arises by the fact could then transition freely in any of the
    none, pmd_trans_huge or pmd_trans_stable states. So making the barrier
    in pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() unconditional isn't good idea
    and it would be a flakey solution.
    
    This should be fully fixed by introducing a read_pmd_atomic that reads
    the pmd in order with THP disabled, or by reading the pmd atomically
    with cmpxchg8b with THP enabled.
    
    Luckily this new race condition only triggers in the places that must
    already be covered by pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() so the fix
    is localized there but this bug is not related to THP.
    
    NOTE: this can trigger on x86 32bit systems with PAE enabled with more
    than 4G of ram, otherwise the high part of the pmd will never risk to
    be truncated because it would be zero at all times, in turn so hiding
    the SMP race.
    
    This bug was discovered and fully debugged by Ulrich, quote:
    
    ----
    [..]
    pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() loads the content of edx and
    eax.
    
        496 static inline int pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad(pmd_t
        *pmd)
        497 {
        498         /* depend on compiler for an atomic pmd read */
        499         pmd_t pmdval = *pmd;
    
                                    // edi = pmd pointer
    0xc0507a74 <sys_mincore+548>:   mov    0x8(%esp),%edi
    ...
                                    // edx = PTE page table high address
    0xc0507a84 <sys_mincore+564>:   mov    0x4(%edi),%edx
    ...
                                    // eax = PTE page table low address
    0xc0507a8e <sys_mincore+574>:   mov    (%edi),%eax
    
    [..]
    
    Please note that the PMD is not read atomically. These are two "mov"
    instructions where the high order bits of the PMD entry are fetched
    first. Hence, the above machine code is prone to the following race.
    
    -  The PMD entry {high|low} is 0x0000000000000000.
       The "mov" at 0xc0507a84 loads 0x00000000 into edx.
    
    -  A page fault (on another CPU) sneaks in between the two "mov"
       instructions and instantiates the PMD.
    
    -  The PMD entry {high|low} is now 0x00000003fda38067.
       The "mov" at 0xc0507a8e loads 0xfda38067 into eax.

    tcp: do_tcp_sendpages() must try to push data out on oom conditions
    
    Since recent changes on TCP splicing (starting with commits 2f533844
    "tcp: allow splice() to build full TSO packets" and 35f9c09f "tcp:
    tcp_sendpages() should call tcp_push() once"), I started seeing
    massive stalls when forwarding traffic between two sockets using
    splice() when pipe buffers were larger than socket buffers.
    
    Latest changes (net: netdev_alloc_skb() use build_skb()) made the
    problem even more apparent.
    
    The reason seems to be that if do_tcp_sendpages() fails on out of memory
    condition without being able to send at least one byte, tcp_push() is not
    called and the buffers cannot be flushed.
    
    After applying the attached patch, I cannot reproduce the stalls at all
    and the data rate it perfectly stable and steady under any condition
    which previously caused the problem to be permanent.
    
    The issue seems to have been there since before the kernel migrated to
    git, which makes me think that the stalls I occasionally experienced
    with tux during stress-tests years ago were probably related to the
    same issue.
    
    This issue was first encountered on 3.0.31 and 3.2.17, so please backport
    to -stable.

    Avoid reading past buffer when calling GETACL
    
    Bug noticed in commit
    bf118a342f10dafe44b14451a1392c3254629a1f
    
    When calling GETACL, if the size of the bitmap array, the length
    attribute and the acl returned by the server is greater than the
    allocated buffer(args.acl_len), we can Oops with a General Protection
    fault at _copy_from_pages() when we attempt to read past the pages
    allocated.
    
    This patch allocates an extra PAGE for the bitmap and checks to see that
    the bitmap + attribute_length + ACLs don't exceed the buffer space
    allocated to it.

    connector/userns: replace netlink uses of cap_raised() with capable()
    
    In 2009 Philip Reiser notied that a few users of netlink connector
    interface needed a capability check and added the idiom
    cap_raised(nsp->eff_cap, CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to a few of them, on the premise
    that netlink was asynchronous.
    
    In 2011 Patrick McHardy noticed we were being silly because netlink is
    synchronous and removed eff_cap from the netlink_skb_params and changed
    the idiom to cap_raised(current_cap(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
    
    Looking at those spots with a fresh eye we should be calling
    capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN).  The only reason I can see for not calling capable
    is that it once appeared we were not in the same task as the caller which
    would have made calling capable() impossible.
    
    In the initial user_namespace the only difference between between
    cap_raised(current_cap(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN) and capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) are a
    few sanity checks and the fact that capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) sets
    PF_SUPERPRIV if we use the capability.
    
    Since we are going to be using root privilege setting PF_SUPERPRIV seems
    the right thing to do.
    
    The motivation for this that patch is that in a child user namespace
    cap_raised(current_cap(),...) tests your capabilities with respect to that
    child user namespace not capabilities in the initial user namespace and
    thus will allow processes that should be unprivielged to use the kernel
    services that are only protected with cap_raised(current_cap(),..).
    
    To fix possible user_namespace issues and to just clean up the code
    replace cap_raised(current_cap(), CAP_SYS_ADMIN) with
    capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN).

    dl2k: Clean up rio_ioctl
    
    The dl2k driver's rio_ioctl call has a few issues:
    - No permissions checking
    - Implements SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCGMIIREG using the SIOCDEVPRIVATE numbers
    - Has a few ioctls that may have been used for debugging at one point
      but have no place in the kernel proper.
    
    This patch removes all but the MII ioctls, renumbers them to use the
    standard ones, and adds the proper permission check for SIOCSMIIREG.
    
    We can also get rid of the dl2k-specific struct mii_data in favor of
    the generic struct mii_ioctl_data.
    
    Since we have the phyid on hand, we can add the SIOCGMIIPHY ioctl too.
    
    Most of the MII code for the driver could probably be converted to use
    the generic MII library but I don't have a device to test the results.

    xen: correctly check for pending events when restoring irq flags
    
    In xen_restore_fl_direct(), xen_force_evtchn_callback() was being
    called even if no events were pending.  This resulted in (depending on
    workload) about a 100 times as many xen_version hypercalls as
    necessary.
    
    Fix this by correcting the sense of the conditional jump.
    
    This seems to give a significant performance benefit for some
    workloads.
    
    There is some subtle tricksy "..since the check here is trying to
    check both pending and masked in a single cmpw, but I think this is
    correct. It will call check_events now only when the combined
    mask+pending word is 0x0001 (aka unmasked, pending)." (Ian)

    Upstream finally got around to fixing the ASLR infoleak I found and fixed
    in grsecurity in 2009.  Three years with the fix in plain sight in the patch,
    yet still it wasn't known or fixed until I explicitly mentioned it to Kees.
    (this seems to be a recurring theme)

    sparc64: Eliminate obsolete __handle_softirq() function
    
    The invocation of softirq is now handled by irq_exit(), so there is no
    need for sparc64 to invoke it on the trap-return path.  In fact, doing so
    is a bug because if the trap occurred in the idle loop, this invocation
    can result in lockdep-RCU failures.  The problem is that RCU ignores idle
    CPUs, and the sparc64 trap-return path to the softirq handlers fails to
    tell RCU that the CPU must be considered non-idle while those handlers
    are executing.  This means that RCU is ignoring any RCU read-side critical
    sections in those handlers, which in turn means that RCU-protected data
    can be yanked out from under those read-side critical sections.
    
    The shiny new lockdep-RCU ability to detect RCU read-side critical sections
    that RCU is ignoring located this problem.
    
    The fix is straightforward: Make sparc64 stop manually invoking the
    softirq handlers.

    sparc64: Fix bootup crash on sun4v.
    
    The DS driver registers as a subsys_initcall() but this can be too
    early, in particular this risks registering before we've had a chance
    to allocate and setup module_kset in kernel/params.c which is
    performed also as a subsyts_initcall().
    
    Register DS using device_initcall() insteal.

    do not export kernel's NULL #define to userspace
    
    GCC's NULL is actually __null, which allows detecting some questionable
    NULL usage and warn about it.  Moreover each platform/compiler should
    have its own stddef.h anyway (which is different from linux/stddef.h).
    
    So there's no good reason to leak kernel's NULL to userspace and
    override what the compiler provides.

    Currently we do not validate the vector length before calling
    get_user_pages_fast(), host stack would be easily overflowed by
    malicious guest driver who give us a descriptor with length greater
    than MAX_SKB_FRAGS. Solve this problem by checking the free entries
    before trying to pin user pages.

    fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid when fcaps are used
    
    If a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous
    personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared.
    Thus programs given priviledge with fcaps will continue to have address space
    randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it
    easier to attack.

    panic: fix stack dump print on direct call to panic()
    
    Commit 6e6f0a1f0fa6 ("panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops")
    causes a regression where no stack trace will be printed at all for the
    case where kernel code calls panic() directly while not processing an
    oops, and of course there are 100's of instances of this type of call.
    
    The original commit executed the check (!oops_in_progress), but this will
    always be false because just before the dump_stack() there is a call to
    bust_spinlocks(1), which does the following:
    
      void __attribute__((weak)) bust_spinlocks(int yes)
      {
    	if (yes) {
    		++oops_in_progress;
    
    The proper way to resolve the problem that original commit tried to
    solve is to avoid printing a stack dump from panic() when the either of
    the following conditions is true:
    
      1) TAINT_DIE has been set (this is done by oops_end())
         This indicates and oops has already been printed.
      2) oops_in_progress > 1
         This guards against the rare case where panic() is invoked
         a second time, or in between oops_begin() and oops_end()

    drivers/char/random.c: fix boot id uniqueness race
    
    /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id can be read concurrently by userspace
    processes.  If two (or more) user-space processes concurrently read
    boot_id when sysctl_bootid is not yet assigned, a race can occur making
    boot_id differ between the reads.  Because the whole point of the boot id
    is to be unique across a kernel execution, fix this by protecting this
    operation with a spinlock.
    
    Given that this operation is not frequently used, hitting the spinlock
    on each call should not be an issue.

    vfs: get rid of batshit-insane pointless dentry hash calculations
    
    For some odd historical reason, the final mixing round for the dentry
    cache hash table lookup had an insane "xor with big constant" logic.  In
    two places.
    
    The big constant that is being xor'ed is GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME, which is a
    fairly random-looking number that is designed to be *multiplied* with so
    that the bits get spread out over a whole long-word.
    
    But xor'ing with it is insane.  It doesn't really even change the hash -
    it really only shifts the hash around in the hash table.  To make
    matters worse, the insane big constant is different on 32-bit and 64-bit
    builds, even though the name hash bits we use are always 32-bit (and the
    bits from the pointer we mix in effectively are too).
    
    It's all total voodoo programming, in other words.
    
    Now, some testing and analysis of the hash chains shows that the rest of
    the hash function seems to be fairly good.  It does pick the right bits
    of the parent dentry pointer, for example, and while it's generally a
    bad idea to use an xor to mix down the upper bits (because if there is a
    repeating pattern, the xor can cause "destructive interference"), it
    seems to not have been a disaster.
    
    For example, replacing the hash with the normal "hash_long()" code (that
    uses the GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME constant correctly, btw) actually just makes
    the hash worse.  The hand-picked hash knew which bits of the pointer had
    the highest entropy, and hash_long() ends up mixing bits less optimally
    at least in some trivial tests.
    
    So the hash function overall seems fine, it just has that really odd
    "shift result around by a constant xor".
    
    So get rid of the silly xor, and replace the down-mixing of the bits
    with an add instead of an xor that tends to not have the same kind of
    destructive interference issues.  Some stats on the resulting hash
    chains shows that they look statistically identical before and after,
    but the code is simpler and no longer makes you go "WTF?".
    
    Also, the incoming hash really is just "unsigned int", not a long, and
    there's no real point to worry about the high 26 bits of the dentry
    pointer for the 64-bit case, because they are all going to be identical
    anyway.
    
    So also change the hashing to be done in the more natural 'unsigned int'
    that is the real size of the actual hashed data anyway.

    ptrace: don't send SIGTRAP on exec if SEIZED
    
    ptrace_event(PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC) sends SIGTRAP if PT_TRACE_EXEC is not
    set.  This is because this SIGTRAP predates PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option,
    we do not need/want this with PT_SEIZED which can set the options during
    attach.

    x86-32: Fix endless loop when processing signals for kernel tasks
    
    The problem occurs on !CONFIG_VM86 kernels [1] when a kernel-mode task
    returns from a system call with a pending signal.
    
    A real-life scenario is a child of 'khelper' returning from a failed
    kernel_execve() in ____call_usermodehelper() [ kernel/kmod.c ].
    kernel_execve() fails due to a pending SIGKILL, which is the result of
    "kill -9 -1" (at least, busybox's init does it upon reboot).
    
    The loop is as follows:
    
    * syscall_exit_work:
     - work_pending:            // start_of_the_loop
     - work_notify_sig:
       - do_notify_resume()
         - do_signal()
           - if (!user_mode(regs)) return;
     - resume_userspace         // TIF_SIGPENDING is still set
     - work_pending             // so we call work_pending => goto
                                // start_of_the_loop
    
    More information can be found in another LKML thread:
    http://www.serverphorums.com/read.php?12,457826
    
    [1] the problem was also seen on MIPS.

    tcp: fix syncookie regression
    
    commit ea4fc0d619 (ipv4: Don't use rt->rt_{src,dst} in ip_queue_xmit())
    added a serious regression on synflood handling.
    
    Simon Kirby discovered a successful connection was delayed by 20 seconds
    before being responsive.
    
    In my tests, I discovered that xmit frames were lost, and needed ~4
    retransmits and a socket dst rebuild before being really sent.
    
    In case of syncookie initiated connection, we use a different path to
    initialize the socket dst, and inet->cork.fl.u.ip4 is left cleared.
    
    As ip_queue_xmit() now depends on inet flow being setup, fix this by
    copying the temp flowi4 we use in cookie_v4_check().

    tun: don't hold network namespace by tun sockets
    
    v3: added previously removed sock_put() to the tun_release() callback, because
    sk_release_kernel() doesn't drop the socket reference.
    
    v2: sk_release_kernel() used for socket release. Dummy tun_release() is
    required for sk_release_kernel() ---> sock_release() ---> sock->ops->release()
    call.
    
    TUN was designed to destroy it's socket on network namesapce shutdown. But this
    will never happen for persistent device, because it's socket holds network
    namespace.
    This patch removes of holding network namespace by TUN socket and replaces it
    by creating socket in init_net and then changing it's net it to desired one. On
    shutdown socket is moved back to init_net prior to final put.

    vfs: Correctly set the dir i_mutex lockdep class
    
    9a7aa12f3911853a introduced additional logic around setting the i_mutex
    lockdep class for directory inodes. The idea was that some filesystems
    may want their own special lockdep class for different directory
    inodes and calling unlock_new_inode() should not clobber one of
    those special classes.
    
    I believe that the added conditional, around the *negated* return value
    of lockdep_match_class(), caused directory inodes to be placed in the
    wrong lockdep class.
    
    inode_init_always() sets the i_mutex lockdep class with i_mutex_key for
    all inodes. If the filesystem did not change the class during inode
    initialization, then the conditional mentioned above was false and the
    directory inode was incorrectly left in the non-directory lockdep class.
    If the filesystem did set a special lockdep class, then the conditional
    mentioned above was true and that class was clobbered with
    i_mutex_dir_key.
    
    This patch removes the negation from the conditional so that the i_mutex
    lockdep class is properly set for directory inodes. Special classes are
    preserved and directory inodes with unmodified classes are set with
    i_mutex_dir_key.

    udf: Fix deadlock in udf_release_file()
    
    udf_release_file() can be called from munmap() path with mmap_sem held.  Thus
    we cannot take i_mutex there because that ranks above mmap_sem. Luckily,
    i_mutex is not needed in udf_release_file() anymore since protection by
    i_data_sem is enough to protect from races with write and truncate.

    vfs: fix double put after complete_walk()
    
    complete_walk() already puts nd->path, no need to do it again at cleanup time.
    
    This would result in Oopses if triggered, apparently the codepath is not too
    well exercised.

    complete_walk() returns either ECHILD or ESTALE.  do_last() turns this into

    sparc32: Add -Av8 to assembler command line.
    
    Newer version of binutils are more strict about specifying the
    correct options to enable certain classes of instructions.
    
    The sparc32 build is done for v7 in order to support sun4c systems
    which lack hardware integer multiply and divide instructions.
    
    So we have to pass -Av8 when building the assembler routines that
    use these instructions and get patched into the kernel when we find
    out that we have a v8 capable cpu.

    x86: Derandom delay_tsc for 64 bit
    
    Commit f0fbf0abc093 ("x86: integrate delay functions") converted
    delay_tsc() into a random delay generator for 64 bit.  The reason is
    that it merged the mostly identical versions of delay_32.c and
    delay_64.c.  Though the subtle difference of the result was:
    
     static void delay_tsc(unsigned long loops)
     {
    -	unsigned bclock, now;
    +	unsigned long bclock, now;
    
    Now the function uses rdtscl() which returns the lower 32bit of the
    TSC. On 32bit that's not problematic as unsigned long is 32bit. On 64
    bit this fails when the lower 32bit are close to wrap around when
    bclock is read, because the following check
    
           if ((now - bclock) >= loops)
           	  	break;
    
    evaluated to true on 64bit for e.g. bclock = 0xffffffff and now = 0
    because the unsigned long (now - bclock) of these values results in
    0xffffffff00000001 which is definitely larger than the loops
    value. That explains Tvortkos observation:
    
    "Because I am seeing udelay(500) (_occasionally_) being short, and
     that by delaying for some duration between 0us (yep) and 491us."
    
    Make those variables explicitely u32 again, so this works for both 32
    and 64 bit.

    aio: fix the "too late munmap()" race
    
    Current code has put_ioctx() called asynchronously from aio_fput_routine();
    that's done *after* we have killed the request that used to pin ioctx,
    so there's nothing to stop io_destroy() waiting in wait_for_all_aios()
    from progressing.  As the result, we can end up with async call of
    put_ioctx() being the last one and possibly happening during exit_mmap()
    or elf_core_dump(), neither of which expects stray munmap() being done
    to them...
    
    We do need to prevent _freeing_ ioctx until aio_fput_routine() is done
    with that, but that's all we care about - neither io_destroy() nor
    exit_aio() will progress past wait_for_all_aios() until aio_fput_routine()
    does really_put_req(), so the ioctx teardown won't be done until then
    and we don't care about the contents of ioctx past that point.
    
    Since actual freeing of these suckers is RCU-delayed, we don't need to
    bump ioctx refcount when request goes into list for async removal.
    All we need is rcu_read_lock held just over the ->ctx_lock-protected
    area in aio_fput_routine().

    aio: fix io_setup/io_destroy race
    
    Have ioctx_alloc() return an extra reference, so that caller would drop it
    on success and not bother with re-grabbing it on failure exit.  The current
    code is obviously broken - io_destroy() from another thread that managed
    to guess the address io_setup() would've returned would free ioctx right
    under us; gets especially interesting if aio_context_t * we pass to
    io_setup() points to PROT_READ mapping, so put_user() fails and we end
    up doing io_destroy() on kioctx another thread has just got freed...

    Use a per-cpu 48-bit counter instead of a global atomic64
    Initialize each counter to have the cpu number in the lower 16 bits
    instead of incrementing the counter each time by 1, perform the increments
    above the cpu number so that wrapping/exhausting the counter doesn't corrupt
    any state

commit a366d0ed963ce93fce10121c1100989d5f064e75

    mm: fix find_vma_prev
    
    Commit 6bd4837de96e ("mm: simplify find_vma_prev()") broke memory
    management on PA-RISC.
    
    After application of the patch, programs that allocate big arrays on the
    stack crash with segfault, for example, this will crash if compiled
    without optimization:
    
      int main()
      {
    	char array[200000];
    	array[199999] = 0;
    	return 0;
      }
    
    The reason is that PA-RISC has up-growing stack and the stack is usually
    the last memory area.  In the above example, a page fault happens above
    the stack.
    
    Previously, if we passed too high address to find_vma_prev, it returned
    NULL and stored the last VMA in *pprev.  After "simplify find_vma_prev"
    change, it stores NULL in *pprev.  Consequently, the stack area is not
    found and it is not expanded, as it used to be before the change.
    
    This patch restores the old behavior and makes it return the last VMA in
    *pprev if the requested address is higher than address of any other VMA.

    vsprintf: make %pV handling compatible with kasprintf()
    
    kasprintf() (and potentially other functions that I didn't run across so
    far) want to evaluate argument lists twice.  Caring to do so for the
    primary list is obviously their job, but they can't reasonably be
    expected to check the format string for instances of %pV, which however
    need special handling too: On architectures like x86-64 (as opposed to
    e.g.  ix86), using the same argument list twice doesn't produce the
    expected results, as an internally managed cursor gets updated during
    the first run.
    
    Fix the problem by always acting on a copy of the original list when
    handling %pV.

    regset: Prevent null pointer reference on readonly regsets
    
    The regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets would always
    have .get and .set methods, but not necessarily .active methods.
    Unfortunately people have since written regsets without .set methods.
    
    Rather than putting in stub functions everywhere, handle regsets with
    null .get or .set methods explicitly.

commit 134ac8545b47f0f27d550ea6e1edb3a1ed7a9748
Author: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com>

    exec: fix use-after-free bug in setup_new_exec()
    
    Setting the task name is done within setup_new_exec() by accessing
    bprm->filename. However this happens after flush_old_exec().
    This may result in a use after free bug, flush_old_exec() may
    "complete" vfork_done, which will wake up the parent which in turn
    may free the passed in filename.
    To fix this add a new tcomm field in struct linux_binprm which
    contains the now early generated task name until it is used.
    
    Fixes this bug on s390:

    relay: prevent integer overflow in relay_open()
    
    "subbuf_size" and "n_subbufs" come from the user and they need to be

    Reported by lavish on IRC:
    If a suid/sgid binary did not learn any setuid/setgid call during learning,
    we would not any CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID capability to the task, nor
    any restrictions on uid/gid changes.  uid and gid can however be changed
    within a suid/sgid binary via setresuid/setresgid with ruid/rgid set to
    euid/egid.
    
    My fix:
    POSIX doesn't specify whether unprivileged users can perform the above
    setresuid/setresgid as an unprivileged user, though Linux has historically
    permitted them.  Modify this behavior when RBAC is enabled to require
    CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID for these operations.
    
    Thanks to Lavish for the report!

      http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1235667/
    
    for details).
    
    This has been updated since I last sent it as the creation of the new
    mm_access() function did almost exactly the same thing as parts of the
    previous version of this patch did.
    
    In order to use mm_access() even when /proc isn't enabled, we move it to
    kernel/fork.c where other related process mm access functions already
    are.

    proc: make sure mem_open() doesn't pin the target's memory
    
    Once /proc/pid/mem is opened, the memory can't be released until
    mem_release() even if its owner exits.
    
    Change mem_open() to do atomic_inc(mm_count) + mmput(), this only
    pins mm_struct. Change mem_rw() to do atomic_inc_not_zero(mm_count)
    before access_remote_vm(), this verifies that this mm is still alive.
    
    I am not sure what should mem_rw() return if atomic_inc_not_zero()
    fails. With this patch it returns zero to match the "mm == NULL" case,
    may be it should return -EINVAL like it did before e268337d.
    
    Perhaps it makes sense to add the additional fatal_signal_pending()
    check into the main loop, to ensure we do not hold this memory if
    the target task was oom-killed.

    eCryptfs: Infinite loop due to overflow in ecryptfs_write()
    
    ecryptfs_write() can enter an infinite loop when truncating a file to a
    size larger than 4G. This only happens on architectures where size_t is
    represented by 32 bits.
    
    This was caused by a size_t overflow due to it incorrectly being used to
    store the result of a calculation which uses potentially large values of
    type loff_t.

    eCryptfs: Check inode changes in setattr
    
    Most filesystems call inode_change_ok() very early in ->setattr(), but
    eCryptfs didn't call it at all. It allowed the lower filesystem to make
    the call in its ->setattr() function. Then, eCryptfs would copy the
    appropriate inode attributes from the lower inode to the eCryptfs inode.
    
    This patch changes that and actually calls inode_change_ok() on the
    eCryptfs inode, fairly early in ecryptfs_setattr(). Ideally, the call
    would happen earlier in ecryptfs_setattr(), but there are some possible
    inode initialization steps that must happen first.
    
    Since the call was already being made on the lower inode, the change in
    functionality should be minimal, except for the case of a file extending
    truncate call. In that case, inode_newsize_ok() was never being
    called on the eCryptfs inode. Rather than inode_newsize_ok() catching
    maximum file size errors early on, eCryptfs would encrypt zeroed pages
    and write them to the lower filesystem until the lower filesystem's
    write path caught the error in generic_write_checks(). This patch
    introduces a new function, called ecryptfs_inode_newsize_ok(), which
    checks if the new lower file size is within the appropriate limits when
    the truncate operation will be growing the lower file.
    
    In summary this change prevents eCryptfs truncate operations (and the
    resulting page encryptions), which would exceed the lower filesystem
    limits or FSIZE rlimits, from ever starting.

    eCryptfs: Make truncate path killable
    
    ecryptfs_write() handles the truncation of eCryptfs inodes. It grabs a
    page, zeroes out the appropriate portions, and then encrypts the page
    before writing it to the lower filesystem. It was unkillable and due to
    the lack of sparse file support could result in tying up a large portion
    of system resources, while encrypting pages of zeros, with no way for
    the truncate operation to be stopped from userspace.
    
    This patch adds the ability for ecryptfs_write() to detect a pending
    fatal signal and return as gracefully as possible. The intent is to
    leave the lower file in a useable state, while still allowing a user to
    break out of the encryption loop. If a pending fatal signal is detected,
    the eCryptfs inode size is updated to reflect the modified inode size
    and then -EINTR is returned.

    eCryptfs: Fix oops when printing debug info in extent crypto functions
    
    If pages passed to the eCryptfs extent-based crypto functions are not
    mapped and the module parameter ecryptfs_verbosity=1 was specified at
    loading time, a NULL pointer dereference will occur.
    
    Note that this wouldn't happen on a production system, as you wouldn't
    pass ecryptfs_verbosity=1 on a production system. It leaks private
    information to the system logs and is for debugging only.
    
    The debugging info printed in these messages is no longer very useful
    and rather than doing a kmap() in these debugging paths, it will be
    better to simply remove the debugging paths completely.

    eCryptfs: Sanitize write counts of /dev/ecryptfs
    
    A malicious count value specified when writing to /dev/ecryptfs may
    result in a a very large kernel memory allocation.
    
    This patch peeks at the specified packet payload size, adds that to the
    size of the packet headers and compares the result with the write count
    value. The resulting maximum memory allocation size is approximately 532
    bytes.

    Add two new features, one is automatic by enabling CONFIG_GRKERNSEC
    (may be changed if it breaks some userland), the other has its own
    config option
    
    First feature requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to write to any sysctl entry via
    the syscall or /proc/sys.
    
    Second feature requires read access to a suid/sgid binary in order
    to ptrace it, preventing infoleaking of binaries in situations where
    the admin has specified 4711 or 2711 perms.  Feature has been
    given the config option CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PTRACE_READEXEC and
    a sysctl entry of ptrace_readexec

    Initial port of grsecurity 2.2.2 for Linux 3.2.1
    Note that the new syscalls added to this kernel for remote process read/write
    are subject to ptrace hardening/other relevant RBAC features
    /proc/slabinfo is S_IRUSR via mainline now, so I made slab_allocators S_IRUSR by default
    as well
    pax_track_stack has been removed from support for this kernel -- if you're running this kernel
    you should be using a version of gcc with plugin support
