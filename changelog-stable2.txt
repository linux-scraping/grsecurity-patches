    This reverts commit 4de79c737b200492195ebc54a887075327e1ec1d.
    
    This patch introduces a new bug which causes access to freed memory.
    In bond_uninit: list_del(&bond->bond_list);
    bond_list is linked in bond_net's dev_list which is freed by
    unregister_pernet_subsys.

    Revert "drivers/net/phy/mdio-bitbang.c: Call mdiobus_unregister before mdiobus_free"
    
    This reverts commit aa731872f7d33dcb8b54dad0cfb82d4e4d195d7e.
    
    As pointed out by Ben Hutchings, this change is not correct.
    
    mdiobus_unregister() can't be called if the bus isn't registered yet,
    however this change can result in situations which cause that to
    happen.
    
    Part of the confusion here revolves around the fact that the
    callers of this module control registration/unregistration,
    rather than the module itself.

        x86_64,ptrace: Enforce RIP <= TASK_SIZE_MAX (CVE-2014-4699)
    
        Don't allow ptrace to set RIP to a value that couldn't happen by
        ordinary control flow. There are CPU bugs^Wfeatures that can have
        interesting effects if RIP is non-canonical.
    
        I didn't make the corresponding x86_32 change, since x86_32 has no
        concept of canonical addresses.
    
        putreg32 doesn't need this fix: value is only 32 bits, so it can't
        be non-canonical.
    
        Fixes CVE-2014-4699.  There are arguably still bugs here, but this
        fixes the major issue.

    lz4: add overrun checks to lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize()
    
    Jan points out that I forgot to make the needed fixes to the
    lz4_uncompress_unknownoutputsize() function to mirror the changes done
    in lz4_decompress() with regards to potential pointer overflows.
    
    The only in-kernel user of this function is the zram code, which only
    takes data from a valid compressed buffer that it made itself, so it's
    not a big issue.  But due to external kernel modules using this
    function, it's better to be safe here.

    ptrace,x86: force IRET path after a ptrace_stop()
    
    The 'sysret' fastpath does not correctly restore even all regular
    registers, much less any segment registers or reflags values.  That is
    very much part of why it's faster than 'iret'.
    
    Normally that isn't a problem, because the normal ptrace() interface
    catches the process using the signal handler infrastructure, which
    always returns with an iret.
    
    However, some paths can get caught using ptrace_event() instead of the
    signal path, and for those we need to make sure that we aren't going to
    return to user space using 'sysret'.  Otherwise the modifications that
    may have been done to the register set by the tracer wouldn't
    necessarily take effect.
    
    Fix it by forcing IRET path by setting TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME from
    arch_ptrace_stop_needed() which is invoked from ptrace_stop().

    ext4: Fix buffer double free in ext4_alloc_branch()
    
    Error recovery in ext4_alloc_branch() calls ext4_forget() even for
    buffer corresponding to indirect block it did not allocate. This leads
    to brelse() being called twice for that buffer (once from ext4_forget()
    and once from cleanup in ext4_ind_map_blocks()) leading to buffer use
    count misaccounting. Eventually (but often much later because there
    are other users of the buffer) we will see messages like:
    VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
    
    Another manifestation of this problem is an error:
    JBD2 unexpected failure: jbd2_journal_revoke: !buffer_revoked(bh);
    inconsistent data on disk
    
    The fix is easy - don't forget buffer we did not allocate. Also add an
    explanatory comment because the indexing at ext4_alloc_branch() is
    somewhat subtle.

    ext4: Fix block zeroing when punching holes in indirect block files
    
    free_holes_block() passed local variable as a block pointer

    variable instead of proper place in inode / indirect block. We later
    zero out proper place in inode / indirect block but don't dirty the
    inode / buffer again which can lead to subtle issues (some changes e.g.
    to inode can be lost).

    ext4: Fix hole punching for files with indirect blocks
    
    Hole punching code for files with indirect blocks wrongly computed
    number of blocks which need to be cleared when traversing the indirect
    block tree. That could result in punching more blocks than actually
    requested and thus effectively cause a data loss. For example:
    
    fallocate -n -p 10240000 4096
    
    will punch the range 10240000 - 12632064 instead of the range 1024000 -
    10244096. Fix the calculation.

    ARM: 8087/1: ptrace: reload syscall number after secure_computing() check
    
    On the syscall tracing path, we call out to secure_computing() to allow
    seccomp to check the syscall number being attempted. As part of this, a
    SIGTRAP may be sent to the tracer and the syscall could be re-written by
    a subsequent SET_SYSCALL ptrace request. Unfortunately, this new syscall
    is ignored by the current code unless TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE is also set on
    the current thread.
    
    This patch slightly reworks the enter path of the syscall tracing code
    so that we always reload the syscall number from
    current_thread_info()->syscall after the potential ptrace traps.

    efi-pstore: Fix an overflow on 32-bit builds
    
    In generic_id the long int timestamp is multiplied by 100000 and needs
    an explicit cast to u64.
    
    Without that the id in the resulting pstore filename is wrong and
    userspace may have problems parsing it, but more importantly files in
    pstore can never be deleted and may fill the EFI flash (brick device?).
    This happens because when generic pstore code wants to delete a file,
    it passes the id to the EFI backend which reinterpretes it and a wrong
    variable name is attempted to be deleted.  There's no error message but
    after remounting pstore, deleted files would reappear.

    lz4: fix another possible overrun
    
    There is one other possible overrun in the lz4 code as implemented by
    Linux at this point in time (which differs from the upstream lz4
    codebase, but will get synced at in a future kernel release.)  As
    pointed out by Don, we also need to check the overflow in the data
    itself.

    "simple" -1 value as the return value is never used for anything other
    than a basic "did this work or not" check.

    ipv4: fix dst race in sk_dst_get()
    
    When IP route cache had been removed in linux-3.6, we broke assumption
    that dst entries were all freed after rcu grace period. DST_NOCACHE
    dst were supposed to be freed from dst_release(). But it appears
    we want to keep such dst around, either in UDP sockets or tunnels.
    
    In sk_dst_get() we need to make sure dst refcount is not 0
    before incrementing it, or else we might end up freeing a dst
    twice.
    
    DST_NOCACHE set on a dst does not mean this dst can not be attached
    to a socket or a tunnel.
    
    Then, before actual freeing, we need to observe a rcu grace period
    to make sure all other cpus can catch the fact the dst is no longer
    usable.

    inet: prevent leakage of uninitialized memory to user in recv syscalls
    
    Only update *addr_len when we actually fill in sockaddr, otherwise we
    can return uninitialized memory from the stack to the caller in the
    recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg syscalls. Drop the the (addr_len == NULL)
    checks because we only get called with a valid addr_len pointer either
    from sock_common_recvmsg or inet_recvmsg.
    
    If a blocking read waits on a socket which is concurrently shut down we
    now return zero and set msg_msgnamelen to 0.

    Fix GRKERNSEC_KSTACKOVERFLOW incompatibility with virtio_net and other more
    rare drivers.  Unfortunately to resolve the problem we had to choose between
    invasive changes to dozens of call-sites and continued future maintenance work,
    or rearchitecting the feature to be able to handle the uses seamlessly.  With
    some tips from pipacs, I chose the latter.
    
    Various drivers including virtio_net use scatterlists derived from stack-based
    buffers (e.g. as an argument to sg_set_buf/sg_init_one).  The scatterlist API
    requires that these buffers be in the kernel image or in kmalloc'd buffers,
    which caused a problem when vmalloc'd stacks were used due to
    GRKERNSEC_KSTACKOVERFLOW.  What we do now is keep the original lowmem kstack
    allocation and then perform a THREAD_SIZE-aligned vmapped alias of the lowmem
    kstack's physical pages.  We also restore kernel stack accounting by using
    this method.  The downside is the existence of the lowmem kstack mapping, but
    the security guarantees of the feature are preserved.
    
    In sg_set_buf() (called by sg_init_one and directly) we now check to see if
    the buffer is on the current kernel stack.  If it is, then we redirect the API
    to the lowmem alias of the kernel stack, preserving its assumptions.
    
    Since the unmapping of the virtual alias can sleep, we need to schedule it
    when called in interrupt context similar to before with vfree.  Unlike before
    however, the contents of the alias depend on the lowmem physical pages, so
    we also need to defer the execution of free_thread_info().
    
    We also have added a temporary debugging measure for this feature by
    adding a BUG_ON() to virt_to_page() to ensure we're not using a vmapped kernel
    stack address for APIs needing lowmem buffers -- this way we can be notified
    of any other APIs that need similar redirection.
    
    Thanks to kocka for assisting with some initial qemu/kernel debugging.

    shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's punched
    
    Trinity finds that mmap access to a hole while it's punched from shmem can
    prevent the madvise(MADV_REMOVE) or fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE) from
    completing, until the reader chooses to stop; with the puncher's hold on
    i_mutex locking out all other writers until it can complete.
    
    It appears that the tmpfs fault path is too light in comparison with its
    hole-punching path, lacking an i_data_sem to obstruct it; but we don't
    want to slow down the common case.
    
    Extend shmem_fallocate()'s existing range notification mechanism, so
    shmem_fault() can refrain from faulting pages into the hole while it's
    punched, waiting instead on i_mutex (when safe to sleep; or repeatedly
    faulting when not).

    futex: Prevent attaching to kernel threads
    
    We happily allow userspace to declare a random kernel thread to be the
    owner of a user space PI futex.
    
    Found while analysing the fallout of Dave Jones syscall fuzzer.
    
    We also should validate the thread group for private futexes and find
    some fast way to validate whether the "alleged" owner has RW access on
    the file which backs the SHM, but that's a separate issue.

    af_iucv: wrong mapping of sent and confirmed skbs
    
    When sending data through IUCV a MESSAGE COMPLETE interrupt
    signals that sent data memory can be freed or reused again.
    With commit f9c41a62bba3f3f7ef3541b2a025e3371bcbba97
    "af_iucv: fix recvmsg by replacing skb_pull() function" the
    MESSAGE COMPLETE callback iucv_callback_txdone() identifies
    the wrong skb as being confirmed, which leads to data corruption.
    This patch fixes the skb mapping logic in iucv_callback_txdone().

    Upstream commit: 2d7a85f4b06e9c27ff629f07a524c48074f07f81
    
    netlink: Only check file credentials for implicit destinations
    
    It was possible to get a setuid root or setcap executable to write to
    it's stdout or stderr (which has been set made a netlink socket) and
    inadvertently reconfigure the networking stack.
    
    To prevent this we check that both the creator of the socket and
    the currentl applications has permission to reconfigure the network
    stack.
    
    Unfortunately this breaks Zebra which always uses sendto/sendmsg
    and creates it's socket without any privileges.
    
    To keep Zebra working don't bother checking if the creator of the
    socket has privilege when a destination address is specified.  Instead
    rely exclusively on the privileges of the sender of the socket.
    
    Note from Andy: This is exactly Eric's code except for some comment
    clarifications and formatting fixes.  Neither I nor, I think, anyone
    else is thrilled with this approach, but I'm hesitant to wait on a
    better fix since 3.15 is almost here.
    
    Note to stable maintainers: This is a mess.  An earlier series of
    patches in 3.15 fix a rather serious security issue (CVE-2014-0181),
    but they did so in a way that breaks Zebra.  The offending series
    includes:

    If a given kernel version is missing that series of fixes, it's
    probably worth backporting it and this patch.  if that series is
    present, then this fix is critical if you care about Zebra.

    percpu-refcount: fix usage of this_cpu_ops
    
    The percpu-refcount infrastructure uses the underscore variants of
    this_cpu_ops in order to modify percpu reference counters.
    (e.g. __this_cpu_inc()).
    
    However the underscore variants do not atomically update the percpu
    variable, instead they may be implemented using read-modify-write
    semantics (more than one instruction).  Therefore it is only safe to
    use the underscore variant if the context is always the same (process,
    softirq, or hardirq). Otherwise it is possible to lose updates.
    
    This problem is something that Sebastian has seen within the aio
    subsystem which uses percpu refcounters both in process and softirq
    context leading to reference counts that never dropped to zeroes; even
    though the number of "get" and "put" calls matched.
    
    Fix this by using the non-underscore this_cpu_ops variant which
    provides correct per cpu atomic semantics and fixes the corrupted
    reference counts.

    futex: Make lookup_pi_state more robust
    
    The current implementation of lookup_pi_state has ambigous handling of
    the TID value 0 in the user space futex. We can get into the kernel
    even if the TID value is 0, because either there is a stale waiters
    bit or the owner died bit is set or we are called from the requeue_pi
    path or from user space just for fun.
    
    The current code avoids an explicit sanity check for pid = 0 in case
    that kernel internal state (waiters) are found for the user space
    address. This can lead to state leakage and worse under some
    circumstances.
    
    Handle the cases explicit:
    
         Waiter | pi_state | pi->owner | uTID      | uODIED | ?
    
    [1]  NULL   | ---      | ---       | 0         | 0/1    | Valid
    [2]  NULL   | ---      | ---       | >0        | 0/1    | Valid
    
    [3]  Found  | NULL     | --        | Any       | 0/1    | Invalid
    
    [4]  Found  | Found    | NULL      | 0         | 1      | Valid
    [5]  Found  | Found    | NULL      | >0        | 1      | Invalid
    
    [6]  Found  | Found    | task      | 0         | 1      | Valid
    
    [7]  Found  | Found    | NULL      | Any       | 0      | Invalid
    [8]  Found  | Found    | task      | ==taskTID | 0/1    | Valid
    [9]  Found  | Found    | task      | 0         | 0      | Invalid
    [10] Found  | Found    | task      | !=taskTID | 0/1    | Invalid
    
    [1]  Indicates that the kernel can acquire the futex atomically. We
         came came here due to a stale FUTEX_WAITERS/FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit.
    
    [2]  Valid, if TID does not belong to a kernel thread. If no matching
         thread is found then it indicates that the owner TID has died.
    
    [3]  Invalid. The waiter is queued on a non PI futex
    
    [4]  Valid state after exit_robust_list(), which sets the user space
         value to FUTEX_WAITERS | FUTEX_OWNER_DIED.
    
    [5]  The user space value got manipulated between exit_robust_list()
         and exit_pi_state_list()
    
    [6]  Valid state after exit_pi_state_list() which sets the new owner in
         the pi_state but cannot access the user space value.
    
    [7]  pi_state->owner can only be NULL when the OWNER_DIED bit is set.
    
    [8]  Owner and user space value match
    
    [9]  There is no transient state which sets the user space TID to 0
         except exit_robust_list(), but this is indicated by the
         FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit. See [4]
    
    [10] There is no transient state which leaves owner and user space
         TID out of sync.

    futex: Always cleanup owner tid in unlock_pi
    
    If the owner died bit is set at futex_unlock_pi, we currently do not
    cleanup the user space futex. So the owner TID of the current owner
    (the unlocker) persists. That's observable inconsistant state,
    especially when the ownership of the pi state got transferred.
    
    Clean it up unconditionally.

    futex: Validate atomic acquisition in
    
    We need to protect the atomic acquisition in the kernel against rogue
    user space which sets the user space futex to 0, so the kernel side
    acquisition succeeds while there is existing state in the kernel
    associated to the real owner.
    
    Verify whether the futex has waiters associated with kernel state. If
    it has, return -EINVAL. The state is corrupted already, so no point in
    cleaning it up. Subsequent calls will fail as well. Not our problem.

    futex-prevent-requeue-pi-on-same-futex.patch
    
    If uaddr == uaddr2, then we have broken the rule of only requeueing
    from a non-pi futex to a pi futex with this call. If we attempt this,
    then dangling pointers may be left for rt_waiter resulting in an
    exploitable condition.
    
    This change brings futex_requeue() into line with
    futex_wait_requeue_pi() which performs the same check as per commit
    6f7b0a2a5 (futex: Forbid uaddr == uaddr2 in futex_wait_requeue_pi())

    Fix a bug with GRKERNSEC_SETXID exhibited by ntpd bailing out when
    being unable to drop privileges.  It drops privileges itself in
    two separate threads, though only one of the threads calls a
    PR_SET_KEEPCAPS which forks off the cred struct.  While it's a little
    silly for ntpd to be doing this (having two threads of different
    privilege with the same shared memory space) we can make GRKERNSEC_SETXID
    compatible by only scheduling a credential change for tasks that share
    a cred struct with the thread that's doing the root -> nonroot setuid
    
    Thanks to strcat for the report

    make pax_track_stack BUG() immediately if it notices the stack getting
    too deep -- this will happen separately to its later check that we're
    clearing too much stack on syscall exit

    Add a new feature for 64-bit kernels to defend against stack overflows
    GRKERNSEC_KSTACKOVERFLOW
    
    Contrary to some naive suggestions on Twitter, it's not just a simple
    process of "adding guard pages" due to how kernel stacks are allocated
    on Linux and the fact that just adding guard pages to that existing
    allocation mechanism would require breaking up large pages, adding a
    large maintenance and performance cost.  Instead we allocate the kernel
    process stacks using vmalloc which provides us with the "guard pages"
    for free, though we only do this on 64-bit architectures (other than Itanium)
    due to the limited space for vmalloc allocations on 32-bit.
    
    We've been working on some other approaches for solving this problem,
    including one that required several advances in GCC plugin analysis, but
    this will exist for now as a stopgap until another approach replaces it.

    mm/filemap.c: avoid always dirtying mapping->flags on O_DIRECT
    
    In some testing I ran today (some fio jobs that spread over two nodes),
    we end up spending 40% of the time in filemap_check_errors().  That
    smells fishy.  Looking further, this is basically what happens:
    
    blkdev_aio_read()
        generic_file_aio_read()
            filemap_write_and_wait_range()
                if (!mapping->nr_pages)
                    filemap_check_errors()
    
    and filemap_check_errors() always attempts two test_and_clear_bit() on
    the mapping flags, thus dirtying it for every single invocation.  The
    patch below tests each of these bits before clearing them, avoiding this
    issue.  In my test case (4-socket box), performance went from 1.7M IOPS
    to 4.0M IOPS.

    x86, mm, hugetlb: Add missing TLB page invalidation for hugetlb_cow()
    
    The invalidation is required in order to maintain proper semantics
    under CoW conditions. In scenarios where a process clones several
    threads, a thread operating on a core whose DTLB entry for a
    particular hugepage has not been invalidated, will be reading from
    the hugepage that belongs to the forked child process, even after
    hugetlb_cow().
    
    The thread will not see the updated page as long as the stale DTLB
    entry remains cached, the thread attempts to write into the page,
    the child process exits, or the thread gets migrated to a different
    processor.

    Checkin:
    
    b3b42ac2cbae x86-64, modify_ldt: Ban 16-bit segments on 64-bit kernels
    
    disabled 16-bit segments on 64-bit kernels due to an information
    leak.  However, it does seem that people are genuinely using Wine to
    run old 16-bit Windows programs on Linux.
    
    A proper fix for this ("espfix64") is coming in the upcoming merge
    window, but as a temporary fix, create a sysctl to allow the
    administrator to re-enable support for 16-bit segments.
    
    It adds a "/proc/sys/abi/ldt16" sysctl that defaults to zero (off). If
    you hit this issue and care about your old Windows program more than
    you care about a kernel stack address information leak, you can do
    
       echo 1 > /proc/sys/abi/ldt16
    
    as root (add it to your startup scripts), and you should be ok.
    
    The sysctl table is only added if you have COMPAT support enabled on
    x86-64, but I assume anybody who runs old windows binaries very much
    does that ;)

    sysfs: make sure read buffer is zeroed
    
    13c589d5b0ac ("sysfs: use seq_file when reading regular files")
    switched sysfs from custom read implementation to seq_file to enable
    later transition to kernfs.  After the change, the buffer passed to
    ->show() is acquired through seq_get_buf(); unfortunately, this
    introduces a subtle behavior change.  Before the commit, the buffer
    passed to ->show() was always zero as it was allocated using
    get_zeroed_page().  Because seq_file doesn't clear buffers on
    allocation and neither does seq_get_buf(), after the commit, depending
    on the behavior of ->show(), we may end up exposing uninitialized data
    to userland thus possibly altering userland visible behavior and
    leaking information.
    
    Fix it by explicitly clearing the buffer.

    mm, thp: close race between mremap() and split_huge_page()
    
    It's critical for split_huge_page() (and migration) to catch and freeze
    all PMDs on rmap walk.  It gets tricky if there's concurrent fork() or
    mremap() since usually we copy/move page table entries on dup_mm() or
    move_page_tables() without rmap lock taken.  To get it work we rely on
    rmap walk order to not miss any entry.  We expect to see destination VMA
    after source one to work correctly.
    
    But after switching rmap implementation to interval tree it's not always
    possible to preserve expected walk order.
    
    It works fine for dup_mm() since new VMA has the same vma_start_pgoff()
    / vma_last_pgoff() and explicitly insert dst VMA after src one with
    vma_interval_tree_insert_after().
    
    But on move_vma() destination VMA can be merged into adjacent one and as
    result shifted left in interval tree.  Fortunately, we can detect the
    situation and prevent race with rmap walk by moving page table entries
    under rmap lock.  See commit 38a76013ad80.
    
    Problem is that we miss the lock when we move transhuge PMD.  Most
    likely this bug caused the crash[1].

    So if, for example, tv_nsec is 0x800000 and shift is 8 we will end up
    with 0xffffffff80000000 instead of 0x80000000. And then we are stuck in
    the subsequent 'while' loop.
    
    We need an explicit cast.

    sparc64: Add basic validations to {pud,pmd}_bad().
    
    Instead of returning false we should at least check the most basic
    things, otherwise page table corruptions will be very difficult to
    debug.
    
    PMD and PTE tables are of size PAGE_SIZE, so none of the sub-PAGE_SIZE
    bits should be set.
    
    We also complement this with a check that the physical address the
    pud/pmd points to is valid memory.
    
    PowerPC was used as a guide while implementating this.

    sparc64: Fix bugs in get_user_pages_fast() wrt. THP.
    
    The large PMD path needs to check _PAGE_VALID not _PAGE_PRESENT, to
    decide if it needs to bail and return 0.
    
    pmd_large() should therefore just check _PAGE_PMD_HUGE.
    
    Calls to gup_huge_pmd() are guarded with a check of pmd_large(), so we
    just need to add a valid bit check.

    sparc64: Fix huge PMD invalidation.
    
    On sparc64 "present" and "valid" are seperate PTE bits, this allows us to
    naturally distinguish between the user explicitly asking for PROT_NONE
    with mprotect() and other situations.
    
    However we weren't handling this properly in the huge PMD paths.
    
    First of all, the page table walker in the TSB miss path only checks
    for _PAGE_PMD_HUGE.  So the generic pmdp_invalidate() would clear
    _PAGE_PRESENT but the TLB miss paths would still load it into the TLB
    as a valid huge PMD.
    
    Fix this by clearing the valid bit in pmdp_invalidate(), and also
    checking the valid bit in USER_PGTABLE_CHECK_PMD_HUGE using "brgez"
    since _PAGE_VALID is bit 63 in both the sun4u and sun4v pte layouts.

    parisc: remove _STK_LIM_MAX override
    
    There are only a couple of architectures that override _STK_LIM_MAX to
    a non-infinity value. This changes the stack allocation semantics in
    subtle ways. For example, GNU make changes its stack allocation to the
    hard maximum defined by _STK_LIM_MAX. As a results, threads executed
    by processes running under make are allocated a stack size of
    _STK_LIM_MAX rather than a sensible default value. This causes various
    thread stress tests to fail when they can't muster more than about 50
    threads.
    
    The attached change implements the default behavior used by the
    majority of architectures.

    Commit 4d619f625a60 ("net: cdc_ncm: no point in filling up the NTBs
    if we send ZLPs") changed the padding logic for devices with the ZLP
    flag set.  This meant that frames of any size will be sent without
    additional padding, except for the single byte added if the size is
    a multiple of the USB packet size. But if the unpadded size is
    identical to the maximum frame size, and the maximum size is a
    multiplum of the USB packet size, then this one-byte padding will
    overflow the buffer.
    
    Prevent padding if already at maximum frame size, letting usbnet
    transmit a ZLP instead in this case.

    fanotify: fix -EOVERFLOW with large files on 64-bit
    
    On 64-bit systems, O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to flags inside
    the open() syscall (also openat(), blkdev_open(), etc).  Userspace
    therefore defines O_LARGEFILE to be 0 - you can use it, but it's a
    no-op.  Everything should be O_LARGEFILE by default.
    
    But: when fanotify does create_fd() it uses dentry_open(), which skips
    all that.  And userspace can't set O_LARGEFILE in fanotify_init()
    because it's defined to 0.  So if fanotify gets an event regarding a
    large file, the read() will just fail with -EOVERFLOW.
    
    This patch adds O_LARGEFILE to fanotify_init()'s event_f_flags on 64-bit
    systems, using the same test as open()/openat()/etc.

    into a temporary kmalloc'd buffer then sent to dmesg via printk().

    isdn: icn: buffer overflow in icn_command()
    
    This buffer over was detected using static analysis:
    
    	drivers/isdn/icn/icn.c:1325 icn_command()
    	error: format string overflow. buf_size: 60 length: 98
    
    The calculation for the length of the string is off because it assumes
    that the dial[] buffer holds a 50 character string, but actually it is
    at most 31 characters and NUL.  I have removed the dial[] buffer because
    it isn't needed.
    
    The maximum length of the string is actually 79 characters and a NUL.  I
    have made the cbuf[] array large enough to hold it and changed the
    sprintf() to an snprintf() as a further safety enhancement.

    coredump: fix va_list corruption
    
    A va_list needs to be copied in case it needs to be used twice.
    
    Thanks to Hugh for debugging this issue, leading to various panics.
    
    Tested:
    
      lpq84:~# echo "|/foobar12345 %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h" >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
    
    'produce_core' is simply : main() { *(int *)0 = 1;}
    
      lpq84:~# ./produce_core
      Segmentation fault (core dumped)
      lpq84:~# dmesg | tail -1
      [  614.352947] Core dump to |/foobar12345 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 lpq84 (null) pipe failed
    
    Notice the last argument was replaced by a NULL (we were lucky enough to
    not crash, but do not try this on your production machine !)
    
    After fix :
    
      lpq83:~# echo "|/foobar12345 %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h %h" >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

    Upstream commit: 1b17844b29ae042576bea588164f2f1e9590a8bc
    
    mm: make fixup_user_fault() check the vma access rights too
    
    fixup_user_fault() is used by the futex code when the direct user access
    fails, and the futex code wants it to either map in the page in a usable
    form or return an error.  It relied on handle_mm_fault() to map the
    page, and correctly checked the error return from that, but while that
    does map the page, it doesn't actually guarantee that the page will be
    mapped with sufficient permissions to be then accessed.
    
    So do the appropriate tests of the vma access rights by hand.
    
    [ Side note: arguably handle_mm_fault() could just do that itself, but
      we have traditionally done it in the caller, because some callers -
      notably get_user_pages() - have been able to access pages even when
      they are mapped with PROT_NONE.  Maybe we should re-visit that design
      decision, but in the meantime this is the minimal patch. ]

    Update to pax-linux-3.14.1-test6.patch:
    - spender fixed various compilation problems on arm, reported by Michael Tremer
    - spender fixed a sparc compile error
    - changed the colorize plugin to be similar to -fdiagnostics-color in gcc 4.9
      - http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.0/gcc/Language-Independent-Options.html
      - by default colorization is off
      - if GCC_COLORS exists in the environment then stderr will be colored if it's a terminal
      - -fplugin-arg-colorize_plugin-color= takes the same arguments as -fdiagnostics-color=
        - e.g., the old behaviour is equivalent to EXTRA_CFLAGS=-fplugin-arg-colorize_plugin-color=always
      - the value of GCC_COLORS isn't parsed yet, the existing colors (red/yellow/blue) are used instead
    - fixed all warnings on the gcc plugins reported by clang
    - fixed a REFCOUNT regression that would instrument code even when REFCOUNT was disabled
